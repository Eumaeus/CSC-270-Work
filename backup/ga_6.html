<b>Apuleius, <i>The Golden Ass</i> Book VI</b><br><br>
[1] “In the meantime Psyche hurled her self hither and thither to seek her husband. She thought that, if he would not be appeased with the sweet flattery of his wife, yet he would take mercy on her for her servile and continual prayers. And (spying a temple on the top of a high hill) she said, ‘Maybe my husband and master is there?’ Wherefore she went there, with great pain and travail, and being moved by hope. After she climbed to the top of the mountain, she came to the temple, and went in. There she saw sheaves of grain lying on a heap, blades withered with garlands, and reeds of barley. Moreover she saw hooks, scythes, sickles, and other instruments for reaping, but everything lay in disorder and, as it were, cast about by the hands of laborers. When Psyche saw this, she gathered up and put everything in order, thinking that she would not despise the temples of any of the gods, but rather get the favor and benevolence of them all. <br><br>
[2] “By and by Ceres came in and, beholding her busily cleaning up in her temple, cried out from far off, and said, ‘O Psyche, needful of mercy, Venus searches for you everywhere to revenge herself and to punish you grievously. But you have more mind to be here, and care for nothing less than for your safety.’ Then Psyche fell on her knees before her, watering her feet with her tears and wiping the ground with her hair. With great weeping and lamentation she begged pardon, saying, ‘O great and holy goddess, I pray your by your plenteous and liberal right hand, by the joyful ceremonies of your harvest, by the secrets of your sacrifice, by the flying chariots of your dragons, by the tillage of the ground of Sicily (which you discovered), by the marriage of Proserpina, by the diligent search for your daughter, and by the other secrets that are within the temple of Eleusis in the land of Athens, take pity on me, your servant Psyche, and let me hide myself a few days amongst these sheaves of grain, until the ire of so great a goddess is past, or at least until I am refreshed of my great labor and travail.’ <br><br>
[3] “Then answered Ceres, ‘Verily, Psyche, I am greatly moved by your prayers and tears, and desire with all my heart to aid you. But if I should suffer you to be hidden here, I would increase the displeasure of my cousin, with whom I have made a treaty of peace and an ancient promise of friendship. Wherefore I advise you to depart hence and not to take it badly that I will not allow you to abide and remain here within my temple.’ Then Psyche, driven away contrary to her hope, was doubly afflicted with sorrow, and so she returned back again. And behold, she perceived a far off in a valley a temple standing within a forest, fair and curiously wrought. Since she intended to pass by no place where better hope directed her, and in order that she could ask pardon of every god, she approached near to the sacred door. There she saw precious riches and vestments engraved with letters of gold hanging upon branches of trees, and the posts of the temple testified the name of the goddess Juno, to whom they were dedicated. Then she kneeled down upon her knees, and embraced the altar with her hands and, wiping her tears, began pray in this way: <br><br>
[4] “‘O dear spouse and sister of the great god Jupiter, you who are adored and worshipped amongst the great temples of Samos, are called upon by women with child, are worshipped at high Carthage because you were brought from heaven by the lion, the rivers of the river Inachus celebrate you. And know that you are the wife of the great god, and the goddess of goddesses. All the eastern part of the world holds you in veneration, all the world calls you Lucina. I pray you to be my advocate in my tribulations, deliver me from the great danger which pursues me, and save me who am weary with so long labors and sorrow. I know that it is you who succors and helps such women as are with child and in danger.’ Then Juno, hearing the prayers of Psyche, appeared to her in all her royalty and said, ‘Truly, Psyche, I would gladly help you, but I am ashamed to do anything contrary to the will of my daughter-in-law Venus, whom I have always loved as my own child. Moreover, I shall incur the danger of the law, entitled, De servo corrupto, whereby I am forbidden to retain any fugitive servant against the will of his master.’ <br><br>
[5] “Then Psyche, cast off likewise by Juno and being without all hope of the recovery of her husband, reasoned with herself in this way: ‘Now what comfort or remedy is left to my afflictions, when my prayers do not avail the goddesses? What shall I do? Whither shall I go? In what cave or darkness shall I hide myself to avoid the fury of Venus? Why do I not take a good heart, and offer myself with humility to her, whose anger I have wrought? Perhaps he (whom I seek) is in his mothers house.’ Thus being in doubt, poor Psyche prepared herself for her own danger, and devised how she might make her prayer to Venus. <br><br>
[6] “After Venus had grown weary of searching by sea and land for Psyche, she returned toward heaven, and commanded that someone should prepare her chariot. This chariot her husband Vulcan gave to her as a marriage present. It was so finely wrought that neither gold nor silver could be compared to its brightness. Four white doves guided the chariot with great diligence, and when Venus entered it a number of sparrows flew chirping about, making signs of joy, and all other kind of birds sang sweetly, indicating the coming of the great goddess. The clouds gave place, the heavens opened and received her joyfully, the birds that followed did not fear the eagle, hawks, or other ravenous fowl of the air. <br><br>
[7] “Swiftly she went to the royal palace of god Jupiter, and with a proud and bold petition demanded the service of Mercury for certain of her affairs, to which Jupiter consented. Then with much joy she descended from heaven with Mercury, and gave him an earnest charge to put in execution her words, saying: ‘O my Brother, born in Arcadia, you know well that I (who am your sister) have never tried to do anything without your presence. You know also how long I have sought for a girl and cannot find her. Thus there is no other recourse than that you, with your trumpet, should pronounce the reward for whoever captures her. See that you put in execution my command, and declare that whosever retains her wittingly against my will shall not defend himself by any means or excuse.’ When she had spoken this, she gave him a paper, wherein was contained the name of Psyche and other details. This done, she departed away to her lodging. <br><br>
[8] “By and by, Mercury (not delaying the matter) proclaimed throughout all the world that whoever could tell any tidings of a king’s fugitive daughter, the servant of Venus, named Psyche, should bring word to Mercury. As reward for his pains, he would receive seven sweet kisses from Venus. After Mercury had pronounced these things, every man was enflamed with desire to search out Psyche. <br><br>
“This proclamation finally put all doubt from Psyche. She had just came in the sight of the house of Venus, when one of her servants, called Custom, came out. She, perceiving Psyche, cried with a loud voice, saying: ‘O wicked harlot, now at length you shall know that you have a mistress above you. What, will you act as though you did not understand what travail we have taken in searching for you? I am glad that you have come into my hands. You are now in the gulf of hell, and shall abide the pain and punishment for your great arrogance. <br><br>
[9] “And thereupon she took Psyche by the hair, and brought her into the presence of the goddess Venus. When Venus saw her, she began to laugh and, as angry persons are accustomed to do, she shook her head and scratched her right ear saying, ‘O goddess, goddess, you have now come at length to visit your husband, who is in danger of death because of you. Be assured I will handle you like a daughter. Where are my maidens, Sorrow and Sadness?’ To them (when they came) she delivered Psyche to be cruelly tormented. They fulfilled the command of their mistress and, after they had piteously scourged her with rods and whips, they presented her again before Venus. Then she began to laugh again, saying: ‘Behold, she thinks (that by reason of her great belly, which she has gotten by playing the whore) to move me to pity and to make me a grandmother to her child. Am I not happy who, in the flourishing time of all my age, shall be called a grandmother! Shall the son of a vile harlot be accounted the grandson of Venus? However, I am a fool to call him by the name of my son, since, as the marriage was made between unequal persons, in the field without witnesses, and not by the consent of parents, the marriage is illegitimate. Therefore the child (that shall be born) is a bastard. Presuming, of course, that we let you live long enough to deliver the child.’ <br><br>
[10] “When Venus had spoken these words she leaped upon the face of poor Psyche and (tearing her apparel) took her by the hair and dashed her head upon the ground. Then she took a great quantity of wheat, of barley, poppy seeds, peas, lentils, and beans, and mingled them together in a heap, saying: ‘You evil-favored girl, you seem unable to get the grace of your lover by no other means than by diligent and painful service. Wherefore I will prove what you can do. See that you separate all these grains one from another, disposing them orderly in their quantity, and let it be done before night.’ When she had appointed this task to Psyche, she departed to a great banquet that had been prepared that day. But Psyche did not go about to sort the grain (since it was impossible to accomplish because they grain lay so confusedly scattered), but being astonished at the cruel command of Venus, sat still and said nothing. Then the little ant, taking pity of her great difficulty and labor, and cursing the cruelty of the daughter of Jupiter and of so evil a mother, ran about, hither and thither, and called to all its friends, ‘O quick sons of the ground, the mother of all things, take mercy on this poor maid, spouse to Cupid, who is in great danger of her person. I pray you help her with all diligence.’ Swiftly one came after another, sorting and dividing the grain. After they had put each kind of grain in order, they ran away again in all haste. <br><br>
[11] “When night came, Venus returned home from the banquet well-tippled with wine, smelling of balm, and crowned with garlands of roses. When she had saw what Psyche had done, she said, ‘This is not the labor of your hands, but rather of he who is amorous of you.’ Then she gave her a morsel of brown bread, and went to sleep. In the meantime, Cupid was closed fast in the most secure chamber of the house, partly so that he would not hurt himself with wanton dalliance, and partly so that he would not speak with his love. So these two lovers were divided one from another. When night was passed Venus called Psyche and said, ‘Do you see yonder forest that extends out in length with the river? Out there are great sheep shining like gold who are kept by no manner of person. I command you to go there and bring me home some of the wool of their fleeces.’ <br><br>
[12] “Psyche arose willingly, not to do her command, but to throw her self headlong into water to end her sorrows. Then a green reed, inspired by divine inspiration, with a gracious tune and melody, said to her, ‘O Psyche, I pray that you not trouble or pollute my water by your death. Yet beware that you not go towards the terrible sheep of this coast until the heat of the sun is past. For when the sun is in his force, they seem most dreadful and furious, with their sharp horns, their stony foreheads and their gaping throats with which they arm themselves to the destruction of mankind. But until they have refreshed themselves in the river, you must hide yourself here by me, under this great plane tree. As soon as their great fury is past, you must go among the thickets and bushes under the wood and gather the locks of their golden fleeces that you find hanging upon the briars.’ <br><br>
[13] “Thus spoke the gentle and benign reed, showing a way for Psyche to save her life. This she bore well in memory, and with all diligence went and gathered up such locks as she found, and put them in her apron, and carried them home to Venus. However, the danger of this second labor did not please the goddess, nor give her sufficient witness of the good service of Psyche. But with a sour resemblance of laughter she said: ‘Certainly I know that this is not your doing, but I will prove if you are of so stout and so good a courage and of singular prudence as you seem to be.’ Then Venus spoke to Psyche again, saying: ‘Do you see the top of yonder great hill, from where there runs down waters of black and deadly color, which nourish the floods of Styx and Cocytus? I charge you to go thither, and bring me a vessel of that water.’ Thereupon she gave her a bottle of crystal and menaced and threatened her rigorously. <br><br>
[14] “Then poor Psyche went in all haste to the top of the mountain, rather to end her life than to fetch any water. When she came up to the ridge of the hill, she perceived that it was impossible to bring it to pass. For she saw a great rock gushing out most horrible fountains of waters, which ran down and fell by many stops and passages into the valley beneath. On each side she saw great dragons, which were stretching out their long and bloody necks, and never slept, but were appointed to keep the river there. The waters seemed to be saying, ‘Away; away, what will you do? Fly, fly, or else you will be slain.’ Then Psyche (seeing the impossibility of this affair) stood still as though she were transformed into a stone and, although she was present in body, yet was absent in spirit and sense because of the great peril which she saw. She could not even comfort herself with weeping, such was the present danger that she was in. <br><br>
[15] “But the royal bird of great Jupiter, the eagle, remembering his old service which he had done, when by the prick of Cupid he brought up the boy Ganymede to the heavens to be made butler of Jupiter, and minding to show the like service in the person of the wife of Cupid, came from the high-house of the skies, and said to Psyche, ‘O simple woman without any experience, do you think you can get any drop of this dreadful water? No, no, assure yourself you will never be able to come near it, for the gods themselves do greatly fear to see it. What, have you not heard that it is customary among men to swear by the power of the gods, and the gods to swear by the majesty of the river Styx? But give me your bottle.’ Suddenly he took it, and filled it with the water of the river, and taking his flight through those cruel and horrible dragons, brought it to Psyche. <br><br>
[16] “She, being very joyful, presented it to Venus, who would not yet be appeased, but menacing more and more said, ‘What, you seem to me a very witch and enchantress, who brings these things to pass. However you shall do nothing more. Take this box to hell and to Proserpina, and ask her to send me a little of her beauty, as much as will serve me the space of one day. Say that what beauty I had has wasted away since my son fell sick. But return again quickly, for I must dress myself with it and go to the theater of the gods.’ <br><br>
[17] “Then poor Psyche perceived the end of all fortune, thinking verily that she would never return, and not without cause, since she was compelled to go into the gulf and furies of hell. Wherefore, without any further delay, she went up to an high tower to throw herself down headlong (thinking that it was the next and readiest way to hell). But the tower (as though inspired) spoke to her saying, ‘O poor wretch, why do you go about to slay your self? Why do you rashly yield to your last peril and danger? Don’t you know that if your spirit is once separated from your body, you shall surely go to hell, and never return again?<br><br>
[18] “‘Wherefore hearken to me. Lacedemon, a city in Greece, is not far from here. Go there and enquire for the hill Taenarus, where you shall find a cave leading to hell, even to the palace of Pluto. But take heed that you do not go with empty hands to that place of darkness. Carry two sops sodden in the flour of barley and honey in your hands, and two pennies in your mouth. And when you have passed a good part of the way, you shall see a lame ass carrying wood, and a lame fellow driving him. He will ask you to give him the sticks that have fallen down. But pass on and do nothing. By and by you shall come to a river of hell where Charon is ferryman. He must first have his fare paid to him before he will carry the souls over the river in his boat. There you may see that avarice reigns even amongst the dead, since neither Charon nor Pluto will do anything for naught. If a poor man wants to pass over and lacks money, he shall be compelled to die in his journey before they will show him any relief. Wherefore deliver to Charon one of the pennies (which you bear for your passage) and let him receive it out of your mouth. And it shall come to pass as you sit in the boat that you shall see an old man swimming on the top of the river, holding up his deadly hands, and asking you to receive him into the boat, but have no regard to his piteous cry. <br><br>
[19] “‘When you have passed over the flood, you shall perceive old women spinning, who will ask you to help them. But beware you do not consent to them in any way, for these and like baits and traps Venus will set to make you drop one of your sops. And do not think that the keeping of your sops is a light matter, for if you lose one of them you shall be assured never to return again to this world. Then you shall see a great and marvelous dog, with three heads, barking continually at the souls that enter in, but he can do them no other harm. He lies day and night before the gate of Proserpina, and keeps the house of Pluto with great diligence. If you cast one of your sops to him, you will have access to Proserpina without all danger. She will make you good cheer, and entertain you with delicate food and drink. But sit upon the ground, and desire brown bread, and then declare your message to her. And when you have received such beauty as she gives, on your return appease the rage of the dog with your other sop, and give your other penny to covetous Charon, and come the same way again into the world as you went. But above all things have a regard that you do not look in the box, neither be not too curious about the treasure of the divine beauty.’ <br><br>
[20] “In this manner tower spoke to Psyche, and told her what she should do. And immediately she took two pennies, two sops, and all things necessary, and went to the mountain Taenarus to go towards hell. After Psyche had passed by the lame ass, paid her penny for passage, neglected the old man in the river, denied to help the woman spinning, and filled the ravenous month of the dog with a sop, she came to the chamber of Proserpina. There Psyche would not sit in any royal seat, nor eat any delicate food, but kneeled at the feet of Proserpina, contented only with coarse bread. She declared her message, and after she had received a mystical secret in a box, she departed, and stopped the mouth of the dog with the other sop, and paid the boatman the other penny. When Psyche returned from hell to the light of the world, she was ravished with great desire, saying, ‘Am not I a fool who, knowing that I carry here divine beauty, will not take a little of it to garnish my face, to please my love?’ <br><br>
[21] “And by and by she opened the box where she could perceive no beauty nor any thing else, save only an infernal and deadly sleep, which immediately invaded all her members as soon as the box was uncovered. In this way that she fell down upon the ground, and lay there as a sleeping corpse. <br><br>
“But Cupid, being now healed of his wound and malady, and not able to endure the absence of Psyche, got himself secretly out at a window of the chamber where he was enclosed, and (receiving his wings,) took his flight towards his loving wife. When he had found her, he wiped away the sleep from her face and put it again into the box, and awakened her with the tip of one of his arrows, saying: ‘O wretched one, behold you nearly perished again because of excessive curiosity. Well, go and give your message to my mother and in the meantime, I will provide for all things accordingly.’ Thereupon he took flight into the air, and Psyche brought her present to Venus. <br><br>
[22] “Cupid, being more and more in love with Psyche and fearing the displeasure of his mother, went into the heavens, and arrived before Jupiter to declare his cause. Then Jupiter, after he had again embraced him, began to speak in this manner: ‘O my well-beloved son, although you have not given due reverence and honor to me as you ought to do, but have rather wounded my breast (whereby the law and order of the elements and planets are disposed) with continual assaults of earthly luxury and against all laws, and the lex Julia, and the public good, nevertheless I remember my reasonableness, and the fact that I have nourished you with my own hands. I will do and accomplish all you desire so that you can beware of spiteful and envious persons. And if there is any excellent maiden of comely beauty in the world, remember yet the benefit which I shall show you by recompense of her love towards me again.’ <br><br>
[23] “When he had spoken these words, he commanded Mercury to call all the gods to council. If any of the celestial powers failed to appear, he would be fined ten thousand sesterces. This sentence was such a terror to all the gods that the high theater was filled. And so Jupiter began to speak in this way: ‘O you gods, registered in the books of the Muses, you all know this young man Cupid, whom I have nourished with my own hands, whose raging flames of his first youth I thought best to bridle and restrain. It suffices that he is defamed in every place for his adulterous living. Every opportunity for such behavior ought to be taken away by means of marriage. He has chosen a maiden that fancies him well, and has bereaved her of her virginity. Let him have her still, and possess her according to his own pleasure.’ <br><br>
[24] “Then he turned to Venus and said, ‘And you, my daughter, take no care, nor fear the dishonor of your progeny and condition, nor have any concern for this mortal marriage. For it seems to me just, lawful, and legitimate by civil law.’ Then Jupiter commanded Mercury to bring up Psyche, the spouse of Cupid, into the palace of heaven. And then he took a pot of immortality, and said, ‘Hold Psyche, and drink, so you will be immortal, and so Cupid may be your everlasting husband.’ By and by the great banquet and marriage feast was sumptuously prepared. Cupid sat down with his dear spouse in his arms, Juno likewise with Jupiter, and all the other gods in order. Ganymede filled the pot of Jupiter, and Bacchus served the rest. Their drink was nectar, the wine of the gods. Vulcan prepared supper, the Hours decked up the house with roses and other sweet smells, the Graces threw about balm, the Muses sang with sweet harmony, Apollo sang pleasantly to the harp, Venus danced finely, Satyrus and Paniscus played on their pipes. Thus Psyche was married to Cupid, and afterward she delivered a child whom we call Pleasure.” <br><br>
[the end of the tale of Cupid and Psyche]<br><br>
[25] This was the story the old woman declared to the captive maiden. But I, poor ass, not standing far of, was not a little sorry that I lacked pen and ink to write down so worthy a tale. By and by the thieves came home laden with treasure, and many of them who were of strongest courage (leaving behind such as were lame and wounded, to heal and aid themselves) said they would return back again to fetch the rest of their pillage, which they had hidden in a certain cave. And so they snatched up their dinner greedily, and brought us forth into the road and beat us before them with staves. About night (after we had passed over many hills and dales) we came to a great cave, where they loaded us with mighty burdens, and would not suffer us to rest ourselves in any way, but brought us again on the road. They went so fast homeward that, what with their haste and their cruel whipping, I fell down upon a stone by the roadside. They beat me pitifully in lifting me up, and hurt my right thigh and my left hoof. <br><br>
[26] And one of them said, “What shall we do with this lame ill-favoured ass, that is not worth the food he eats?” And other said, “Since the time we found him he has never done any good, and I think he came to our house with evil luck, for we have had great wounds since, and have lost our valiant captains.” And the other said, “As soon as he has brought home his burden, I will surely throw him out upon the mountain to be a pray for wild beasts.” While these gentlemen reasoned together about my death, we happened to come home, for the fear that I was in caused my feet to turn into wings. After we were discharged of our burdens, they went to their fellows who were wounded, and told them of our great slowness on the road. I was not brought into small anguish when I perceived my death prepared before my face. “Why do you stand still Lucius? Why do you not look for your death? Do you not know that the thieves have ordained to slay you? Do you not see these sharp and pointed stones which shall bruise and tear you into pieces, if you happen to be thrown upon them? Your gentle magician has not only given you the shape and travail of an ass, but also a skin as soft and tender as a swallow. Why do you not take courage and run away to save yourself? Are you afraid of the old woman, more than half dead, whom with a blow of your heel you could easily dispatch? But whither shall I fly? What lodging shall I seek? See my ass-like cogitation. Who would not, in passing on the road, take me up?” <br><br>
[27] While I devised these things, I broke the halter with which I was tied and ran away with all my force. However, I could not escape the keen eyes of the old woman, for she ran after me, and with more audacity than became her old age, she caught me by the halter and thought to pull me home. But I, not forgetting the cruel purpose of the thieves, was moved with small pity, for I kicked her with my hind heels to the ground and well nigh slew her. But she (although she was thrown and hurled down) held still the halter, and would not let me go. Then she cried with a loud voice and called for succor, but she little prevailed, because there was no person that heard her, save only the captive gentlewoman. She, hearing the voice of the old woman, came out to see what the matter was and, perceiving her hanging at the halter, took good courage and wrested it out of her hand, and (entreating me with gentle words) got upon my back. Then I began to run, and she gently kicked me forward. <br><br>
[28] I was not displeased by this, for I had as great a desire to escape as she did. So much so that I seemed to run away like a horse. And when the gentlewoman spoke to me, I would answer her with my neighing, and oftentimes (under the pretense of scratching my back) I would sweetly kiss her tender feet. Then she, fetching a sigh from the bottom of her heart, lifted up her eyes to the heavens, saying: “O sovereign gods, deliver me, if it is your pleasure, from these present dangers. And you, cruel Fortune, cease your wrath, let the sorrow suffice that I have already sustained. And you, little ass, who are the occasion of my safety and liberty, if you can once render me safe and sound to my parents, and to him who so greatly desires to have me to his wife, you shall see what thanks I will give. With what honor I will reward you, and how I will use you! First, I will beautifully dress the hairs of your forehead, and then will I finely comb your mane, I will tie up your rugged tail trimly, I will deck you round about with golden trappings, in such sort that you shall glitter like the stars of the sky. I will bring you daily in my apron the kernels of nuts, and will pamper you with delicacies. I will set store by you, as by one that is the preserver of my life. Finally, you shall lack nothing. <br><br>
[29] “Moreover, amongst your glorious fare, your great ease, and the bliss of your life, you shall not be destitute of dignity, for you shall be chronicled perpetually in the memory of my present fortune, and providence divine. All the story shall be painted upon the wall of our house, you shall he renowned throughout all the world. And it shall be registered in the books of scholars, that an ass saved the life of a young maiden who was captive amongst thieves. You shall be numbered amongst the ancient miracles. We believe that in a similar way Phrixus saved himself from drowning by riding upon the ram, Arion escaped upon a dolphin, and that Europa was delivered by the bull. If Jupiter transformed himself into a bull, why may it not be that under the shape of this ass is hidden the figure of a man, or some power divine?” While the virgin thus sorrowfully unfolded her desires, we happened to come to a place where three roads met. She took me by the halter and wanted me to turn to the right hand, to her father’s house. But I (knowing that the thieves had gone that way to fetch the rest of their pillage) resisted with my head as much as I could, saying within myself: “What will you do, unhappy maiden? Why would you go so willingly to hell? Why will you run to destruction by means of my feet? Why do you seek your own harm, and mine likewise?” And while we strived together regarding which way we might take, the thieves returned, laden with their spoils, and perceived us far off by the light of the moon. And soon they perceived who we were. <br><br>
[30] One of them said, “Whither do you go so hastily? Are you not afraid of spirits? And you (you harlot), do you not go to see your parents? Come on, we will bear you company.” And therewith they took me by the halter, and drove me back again, beating me cruelly with a great staff (that they had) full of knobs. Then I, returning again to my ready destruction, and remembering the injury to my hoof, began to shake my head and act lame. But he who led me by the halter said, “What, do you stumble? Can you not go? These rotten feet of yours ran well enough before, but now they cannot walk. You could mince it finely even now with the gentlewoman, such that you seemed to surpass the horse Pegasus in swiftness.” In saying these words they beat me again, so that they broke a great staff upon me. And when we were almost home, we saw the old woman hanging upon a bough of a cypress tree. Then one of them cut down the bough on which she hanged, and cast her into the bottom of a great ditch. <br><br>
[31] After this, they bound the maiden and fell greedily to their victuals, which the miserable old woman had prepared for them. Then they began to devise with themselves about our death, and how they might be revenged. Diverse were the opinions of this diverse number. One man said that he thought it best that the maid should be burned alive. Another said she should be thrown out to wild beasts. A third said that she should be hanged upon a gibbet. A fourth said she should be flayed alive. Thus the death of the poor maiden was discussed between these four. But one of the thieves, after every man had declared his judgment, spoke in this manner: “It is not appropriate to the oath of our company to suffer you to act more cruelly than the degree of the offence merits. I would recommend that she should not be hanged nor burned, nor thrown to beasts, nor die any sudden death. But by my counsel I would have her punished according to her desert. You know well what you have determined already for this dull ass, who eats more then he is worth, who feigns lameness, and who was the cause of the flying away of the maid. My mind is that he shall be slain tomorrow, and when all the guts and entrails of his body are taken out, let the maid be sewn into his belly, then let us lay them upon a great stone in the broiling heat of the sun. <br><br>
[32] “Thus they shall both sustain all the punishments which you have ordained. First the ass shall be slain as you have determined, and she shall have her members torn and gnawed by wild beasts. When she is bitten and rent by worms, she shall endure the pain of the fire, when the broiling heat of the sun shall scorch and parch the belly of the ass. She shall abide the gallows when the dogs and vultures have the guts of her body hanging in their ravenous mouths. I pray you, number all the torments which she shall suffer. First she shall dwell within the paunch of an ass. Second her nostrils shall receive the foul stink of the beast. Third she shall die of hunger. Last of all, she shall find no means to rid her self from her pains, for her hand shall be sewn up within the skin of the ass.” This being said, all the thieves consented. When I (poor ass) heard and understood all their designs, I did nothing else but lament and bewail my dead carcass, which should be handled in such sort the next morning. <br><br>
