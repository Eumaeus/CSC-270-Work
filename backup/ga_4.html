<b>Apuleius, <i>The Golden Ass</i> Book IV</b><br><br>
[1] When noon arrived and when the broiling heat of the sun was strongest, we turned into a village to meet certain of the thieves’ acquaintances and friends. Their greeting and embracing gave me, poor ass, to understand this. And they took the truss from my back, and gave them part of the treasure, and they seemed to whisper and tell them that it was stolen goods. After we were unloaded of our burdens, they let us loose in a meadow to pasture, but my own horse and Milo’s ass would not allow me to feed there with them, but I had to seek my dinner in some other place. Wherefore I leaped into a garden which was behind the stable and, being nearly dead with hunger and although I could find nothing there but raw and green vegetables, yet I filled my hungry guts abundantly and, praying to all the gods, I looked about in every place to see if I could spy any red roses in the gardens nearby. Being alone did put me in good hope that if I could find any remedy, I would presently be changed from an ass into Lucius out of every man’s sight. <br><br>
[2] And while I considered these things, I looked about and behold, I saw a far off a shadowed valley near a wood where amongst diverse other herbs and pleasant verdures I thought I saw bright flourishing roses of bright damask color. I said to myself, “Verily that place is the place of Venus and the Graces where secretly glistens the royal hue of so lively and delectable a flower.” Then I, asking the help of the gods, ran lustily towards the wood, so much so that I felt that I was no longer an ass but a swift racehorse. But my agility and quickness could not prevent the cruelty of my fortune for, when I came to the place, I saw that they were not roses, neither tender nor pleasant, neither moistened with the heavenly drops of dew, nor celestial liquor, which grew out of the thicket and thorns there. Neither did I perceive that there was any valley at all, but only the bank of the river, environed with great thick trees. These had long branches like laurel, and bore a flower without any manner of scent. The common people call these by the name of laurel roses, which are very poisonous to all manner of beasts. <br><br>
[3] I was at that point so entangled with unhappy fortune that I little esteemed my own danger, and went willingly to eat of these roses, though I knew them to be poisonous. As I drew near I saw a young man who seemed to be the gardener coming upon me, and when he perceived that I had devoured all his herbs in the garden, he came swearing with a great staff in his hand, and beat me in such way that I was nearly dead. But I speedily devised some remedy myself, for I lifted up my legs and kicked him with my hind heels, so that I left him lying at the hill foot nearly slain, and then I ran away. Quickly his wife came out who, seeing her husband half-dead, cried and howled in pitiful sort, and went toward her husband so that by her loud cries she might bring about my destruction. Then all the persons of the town, moved by her noise, came forth and cried for dogs to tear me down. Out came a great company of bulldogs and mastiffs, more fit to pull down bears and lions than me. When I beheld them I thought truly I would presently die. But I turned myself about and ran as fast as I could to the stable from which I came. Then the men of the town called in their dogs, and took me and bound me to the staple of a post, and scourged me with a great knotted whip till I was nearly dead. They would undoubtedly have slain me, had it not come to pass that, what with the pain of their beating and the green herbs that lay in my guts, I caught such a diarrhea that I all besprinkled their faces with my liquid dung, and forced them to leave off. <br><br>
[4] Not long after, the thieves loaded us up again, and especially me, and brought us forth from the stable. When we had gone a good part of our journey, because of the length of the trek, my great burden, the beating of staves, and my worn hooves, I was so weary that I could barely go. Then I saw before me a river running with fair water, and I said to myself, “Behold, now I have found a good opportunity. For I will fall down when I come yonder and I will not rise again, not even with scourging or with beating. For I would rather be slain there presently, than go any further.” And the reason why I determined to do this was as follows: I thought that the thieves, when they saw me so feeble and weak that I could not travel, since they would not want a delay in their journey, would take the burden from my back and put it on my fellows, and so for my further punishment to leave me as a prey to the wolves and ravening beasts. <br><br>
[5] But evil fortune prevented so good a plan. For the other ass, being of the same purpose as me, by feigned weariness fell down first with all his burden on the ground as though he were dead. He would not rise either with beating or with pricking, or stand upon his legs, though they pulled him by the tail, by his legs, and by his ears. When the thieves beheld this, as though without all hope they said one to another, “Why should we stand here so long about a dead or rather a stony ass? Let us be gone.” And so they took his burden and divided between me and my horse. And then they drew out their swords and cut off the ass’ legs, and threw his body from the point of a hill down into a great valley. Then I, considering the evil fortune of my poor companion, decided now to forget all subtlety and deceit and to play the good ass to get my masters’ favor, for I perceived by their talk that we had come nearly to our journey’s end. And after we had passed over a little hill, we came to our appointed place. When we were unloaded of our burdens, and all things carried in, I tumbled and wallowed in the dust to refresh myself instead of with water. <br><br>
[6] The matter and the time compels me to make description of the place, and especially of the den where the thieves lived. I will prove my wit in what I can do: consider whether I was an ass in judgment and sense, or not. For first there was an exceedingly high hill surrounded with big trees and with many ravines full of sharp stones, whereby it was inaccessible. There were many winding and hollow valleys, environed with thickets and thorns, and naturally fortressed round about. From the top of the hill ran a stream as clear as silver that watered all the valleys below, which seemed like an inland sea or a standing flood. In front of the den, where was no hill, stood a high tower, at the foot of which there were sheepfolds fenced and walled with clay. Before the gate of the house were paths made instead of walls. On the whole you could easily judge it to be a very den for thieves, and there was nothing else except a little hut covered with thatch, where the thieves were accustomed to stand watch nightly, as I after perceived. <br><br>
[7] And when they had all crept into the house and we were all tied fast with halters at the door, they began to chide an old woman there, crooked with age, who was in charge of all the house. They said, “How is it, old witch, old trot, and strumpet, that you sit idly all day at home and having no regard to our perilous labors? Have you provided nothing for our suppers, but sit eating and swilling yourself from morning till night?” Then the old woman trembled and, scarcely able to speak, said, “Behold, my powerful and faithful masters, you shall have food and pottage enough soon. Here is the store of bread, plenty of wine poured in clean-rinsed pots, likewise here is hot water prepared to bathe you.” When she had said this, they took off all their garments and refreshed themselves by the fire. And after they were washed and anointed with oil, they sat down at the table that had been garnished with all kind of dainty foods. <br><br>
[8] They had no sooner sat down, when another company of young men came in, more in number than was before, who seemed likewise to be thieves. For they brought in their loot gold and silver, plate, jewels, and rich robes. When they had likewise washed, they sat among the rest and served one another by order. Then they drank and ate exceedingly, laughing, crying and making much noise, such that I thought that I was among the tyrannous and wild Lapiths, Thebans, and Centaurs. At length one of them, more valiant than the rest, spoke in this way, “We indeed have valiantly conquered the house of Milo of Hypata, and beside all the riches and treasure which by force we have brought away, we have all come home safe, and are increased the more by this horse and this ass. But you, who have roved about in the country of Boeotia, have lost your valiant captain Lamachus, whose life I valued more than all the treasure that you have brought. Therefore the memory of him shall be renowned forever amongst the most noble kings and valiant captains. But you, when you go abroad, seem like men with ganders’ hearts who creep through every corner and hole for every trifle.” <br><br>
[9] Then one of the latter group answered, “Why, are you ignorant of the fact that the greater the number of victims is, the easier it will be to rob and spoil the house? Although the family is dispersed in diverse lodgings, yet every man would rather defend his own life than to save the riches of his master. But when there are but a few thieves, then will they not only rather save themselves, but also their possessions, how little or great it is. So that you may believe me I will show you an example. We had arrived near Thebes, the source of our art and science, when we learned where a rich money-lender called Chryseros lived. This man, to avoid public duty, dissembled his condition and lived by himself shabbily, though possessing an abundance of treasure, and everyday went about in ragged and torn clothing. Wherefore we decided to go to his house and spoil him of all his riches. <br><br>
[10] When night came we drew towards the door, which was so strongly barred that we could neither move it nor lift it out of the hooks. We thought it best not to break it open lest by the noise we should rouse the neighbors nearby. Then our strong and valiant captain Lamachus, trusting in his own strength and force, thrust in his hand through a hole in the door, intending to pull back the bolt. But the covetous wretch Chryseros, being awake and making no noise, came softly to the door and caught his hand and with a great nail nailed it to the doorpost. When he had done this, he ran up to the high chamber and called everyone of his neighbors by name, asking them to succor him with all possible speed, saying that his own house was on fire. Then every one, fearing for himself, came running out to aid him.<br><br>
[11] Wherewith we, fearing our present peril, were unsure as to what was best to do, whether we should leave our companion there, or yield ourselves to die with him. But we by his consent devised a better way, for we cut off his arm by the elbow and let it hang there. Then we bound his wound with cloths, lest we should be traced by the drops of blood. This done, we took Lamachus and led him away, for fear we would be captured. But we were so closely pursued that we were in immediate danger, and Lamachus could not keep our company by reason of faintness. And for his part, perceiving that it was not for his profit to linger behind, he spoke to us as a man of singular courage and virtue, imploring us by much entreaty and prayer and by the power of the god Mars, and by the faith of our confederacy, to deliver his body from torment and miserable captivity. And further he said, “How is it possible that so courageous a captain as I can live without his hand, with which I once robbed and slew so many people? I would think myself sufficiently happy if I could be slain by one of you.” But when he saw that we all refused to commit any such deed, he drew out his sword with his other hand and, after he kissed it many times, he drove it clean through his body. Then we honored the corpse of so powerful a man, and wrapped it in linen clothes and threw it into the sea. <br><br>
[12] So lies our master Lamachus, buried in a grave of water. He ended his life as I have declared. But Alcimus, though he was a man of great enterprise, yet he could not beware by Lamachus, nor void himself from evil fortune. One day, when he had entered into an old woman’s house to rob her, he went up into a high chamber where he should first have strangled her. But he had more concern to throw down the bags of money and gold out at a window to those of us who stood underneath. And since he was so greedy that he would leave nothing behind, he went into the old woman’s bed where she lay asleep, and would have taken off the coverlet and thrown it down likewise, but she woke up, and kneeling on her knees, begged him in this manner: “O sir I pray you not to cast away such torn and ragged cloths into my neighbors’ houses, for they are rich enough, and need no such things.” Then Alcimus, thinking her words to be true, was deceived into believing that the things he had thrown out already, and the things he was going throw out after, had not fallen down to his fellows, but into other men’s houses. Wherefore he went to the window to see the places round about, thrusting his body out of the window. The old woman marked him well, and came behind him softly, and though she had but small strength, yet with sudden force she took him by the heels and thrust him out headlong, and so he fell upon a marvelous great stone and burst his ribs. As a result he vomited and spewed great clots of blood and presently died. Then we threw him to the river likewise, as we had done Lamachus before. <br><br>
[13] Since we had thus lost two of our companions, we left Thebes and marched towards the next city called Plataea, where we found a man of great fame called Demochares, who intended to put on a great festival in which there would be a trial of all kind of weapons. He came from a good house, was marvelous rich, liberal, and well-deserved that which he had. He had prepared many shows and pleasures for the common people such that there is no man who can either by wit or eloquence show in words his worthy preparations. First he had provided all sorts of arms and he greatly delighted in hunting and chasing. He made many places to chase and encounter in. He had ready a great number of men and wild beasts, and many condemned persons were brought from the judgment place to try and fight with those beasts. But amongst so great preparations of noble price, he bestowed the most part of his patrimony in buying bears, which he nourished to his great cost, and esteemed more than all the other beasts, which either by chasing he caught himself, or which he dearly bought, or which were given to him by his many friends. <br><br>
[14] However, for all this sumptuous cost, he could not be free from the malicious eyes of envy, for some of the bears were nearly dead from being confined too long, some were weak because of the broiling heat of the sun, some languished in inactivity, but all, having various diseases, were so afflicted that they died one after another. There was nearly none left; indeed you might see them lying in the streets piteously dead. And the common people, having no other meat to feed on and little regarding any curiosity, would come forth and fill their bellies with the flesh of the bears. Then by and by Eubulus and I devised a pretty sport: we drew one of the greatest of the dead bears to our lodging, as though we were going to eat it. We stripped it of its skin, and kept his nails whole, but we did not meddle with the head, but cut it off by the neck, and so let it hang to the skin. Then we scraped off the flesh from the neck, and cast dust on it, and set it in the sun to dry. <br><br>
While the skin was a drying we made merry with the flesh, and then we devised that one of us, being more valiant than the rest both in body and courage (so that he would consent to the plan), should put on the skin and, pretending that he was a bear, should be led to Demochares’ house in the night. By this means we thought we could be let into the house. <br><br>
[15] Many were desirous to play the bear, but one Thrasyleon, a man of a courageous mind, especially wanted to take this enterprise in hand. And so we put him into the bear’s skin, which fit him finely in every point. We buckled it fast under his belly, and covered the seam with the hair so that it might not be seen. After this we made little holes through the bear’s head, and through his nostrils and eyes so Thrasyleon could see and breathe. In this way he seemed a very lively and natural beast. When this was done we went into a cave which we used for the purpose, and he crept in after bravely like a bear. Thus we began our subtlety, and we schemed as follows. <br><br>
[16] We feigned letters as though they came from one Nicanor, who dwelt in the country of Thrace and who was of great acquaintance with this Demochares. In them we wrote that he had sent him, being his friend, the first fruits of his hunting. When night had come, which was a convenient time for our purpose, we brought Thrasyleon and our forged letters and presented them to Demochares. When Demochares beheld this mighty bear, and saw the liberality of Nicanor his friend, he commanded his servants to deliver to us ten gold coins (he had a great store of these in his coffers). Then (as the novelty of a thing is accustomed to stir men’s minds to behold it) many persons came on every side to see this bear. But Thrasyleon, lest they should by curious viewing and prying perceive the truth, ran upon them to put them in fear so that they not come near. The people said, “Verily Demochares is right happy in that after the death of so many beasts, he has gotten, in spite of fortune’s head, so goodly a bear.” Then Demochares commanded that he should be put with all care in the park with all the other beasts. <br><br>
[17] But immediately I spoke to him and said, “Sir I pray you, consider that you are putting a beast, tired with the heat of the sun and with long travel, among others which, as I hear, have many maladies and diseases. Let him rather lie in some open place in your house near some water, where he may take air and ease himself. Do you not know that such beasts greatly delight in resting under the shadow of trees and hillocks near pleasant wells and waters?” Demochares was admonished by this and, remembering how many bears had perished before, was contented that we should put the bear where we would. Moreover, we said to him that we ourselves were determined to lie all night near the bear and look after him, and to give him food and drink at his due hour. Then he answered, “Verily, masters, you need not put yourselves to such pains, for I have men who do nothing else but that.” <br><br>
[18] So we took leave of him and departed. When we got outside the gates of the town, we perceived before us a great tomb standing away from the road in a privy and secret place, and we went up to it and opened its entrance. We found that the sides of it were covered with the corruption of man, and the ashes and dust of his long buried body. We went inside to bring our purpose to pass and, having respect to the dark time of night, as is our custom, when we thought that every one was asleep, we went with our weapons and besieged the house of Demochares. Then Thrasyleon was ready at hand, and leaped out of the cavern, and went to kill all those he found asleep. But when he came to the porter, he opened the gates and let us in, and then he showed us a large counter, in which we saw the night before a great abundance of treasure. When we had forced it open, I bid every one of my fellows take as much gold and silver as they could carry away and bear it to the tomb. As they carried it away I stood at the gate, watching diligently when they would return. The bear ran about the house in order to frighten those family members who happened to wake up and come out. For who is he that is so powerful and courageous that, at the ugly sight of so great a monster, he will not be afraid and keep to his chamber, especially in the night? <br><br>
[19] But when things seemed to be going so well, something unfortunate happened: for as I looked for my companions who were returning from the tomb, behold, there was a boy of the house who happened to look out of a window and saw the bear running about. Then he went and told all the servants of the house. Whereupon they quickly came forth with torches, lanterns, and other lights so that they might see all over the yard. They came with clubs, spears, naked swords, greyhounds, and mastiffs, in order to slay the poor beast. <br><br>
[20] Then I, during this confusion, was going to run away, but because I desired see Thrasyleon fight with the dogs, I lay behind the gate to watch him. Although he was pretty much doomed, nevertheless he remembered his own faithfulness and ours, and valiantly resisted the gaping and ravenous mouths of the hell hounds. So he took in earnest the role that willingly he took in hand himself, and with much ado tumbled at length out of the house. But although he seemed to have gotten away, yet he could not save himself, for all the dogs of the street joined the greyhounds and mastiffs of the house, and came upon him. Alas, what a pitiful sight it was to see our poor Thrasyleon thus surrounded by so many dogs who tore and rent him miserably. Then I, impatient of so great a misery, ran in among the press of people and, aiding him with my words as much as I could, exhorted them all in this manner: “O great and extreme misfortune, what a precious and excellent beast have we lost.” <br><br>
[21] But my words accomplished nothing, for there came out a tall man with a spear in his hand who thrust Thrasyleon clean through, and afterwards many of those who stood by drew out their swords, and so they killed him. But indeed our good captain Thrasyleon, the honor of our comfort, received his death so steadfastly that he did not betray the league between us, either by crying, howling, or any other means. But, being torn by dogs and wounded with weapons, he gave forth a doleful cry, more like a beast than a man. And taking his present fortune in good part, with courage and glory enough he finished his life, with such a terror to the assembly that no person was brave enough, until it was day, to touch him even though he was stark dead. But at last there came a butcher, more valiant than the rest, who opened the paunch of the beast and slit out a hardy and adventurous thief. In this manner we lost our captain Thrasyleon, but he did not diminish his fame and honor. When this was done we packed up our treasure (which we had hidden in the tomb) and got out of Plataea, thinking to ourselves that there was more fidelity amongst the dead than amongst the living, since our prize had been so safely kept in the tomb. So, being wearied with the weight of our burdens, and very tired with long travel, and having lost three of our soldiers, we are come home with these present spoils.” <br><br>
[22] Thus when they had spoken in memory of their slain companions, they took cups of gold, and sung hymns to the god Mars, and laid themselves down to sleep. Then the old woman gave us fresh barley without measure, such that my horse fed so abundantly that he might well have thought he was at some banquet that day. But I, who was accustomed to eat bran and flour, thought that it was a poor kind of meal. Wherefore I, espying a corner where lay loaves of bread for all the house, went and filled my hungry guts with the bread. When night had come the thieves awaked and rose up, and when they had buckled on their weapons and disguised their faces, they departed. And yet for all weariness I felt, I could in no way stop eating. Whereas when I was a man I could be contented with one or two loaves at the most, now my guts were so greedy that three panniers full would scarcely satisfy me. <br><br>
[23] And while I considered these things the morning came and I, being led to a river, and notwithstanding my ass-like shame, quenched my thirst. And suddenly after the thieves returned home full of care, bringing no burdens with them, not even  a cheap rag or baggage, but only a maiden who seemed by her carriage to be some gentlewoman, and the daughter of some worthy matron of that country. She was so fair and beautiful, that, though I was an ass, yet I had a great affection for her. The virgin lamented and tore her hair, and rent her garments because of the great sorrow she was in. But the thieves brought her into the cave and tried to comfort in this way, “Weep not, fair gentlewoman, we pray you. For be assured that we will do no outrage or violence to your person. But be patient a while for our profit, for necessity and poor condition has compelled us to abduct you. We warrant you that your parents, although they are greedy, will be contented to give us a great quantity of money to redeem and ransom you from our hands.” <br><br>
[24] With such flattering words they endeavored to appease the gentlewoman. However, she would in no way be comforted, but put her head betwixt her knees, and cried piteously. Then they called the old woman and commanded her to sit by the maiden and pacify her grief as well as she could. Then they departed for robbery, as they were accustomed to do. But the virgin would not assuage her grief, nor mitigate her sorrow by any entreaty of the old woman, but howled and sobbed so much that she made me, poor ass, likewise weep. And thus she said, “Alas, can I, poor wench, live any longer? I who have come of so good a house, who am forsaken of my parents, friends, and family, made a rapine and prey, closed slavishly in this stony prison, deprived of all pleasure? Can I, who have been brought here, thrown into danger, ready to be rent in pieces among so many sturdy thieves and dreadful robbers, cease from weeping and live any longer?” Thus she cried and lamented, and after she had wearied herself with sorrow and worn out her face with tears, she closed the windows of her hollow eyes and laid herself down to sleep. <br><br>
[25] And after she had slept, she rose again like a furious and mad woman, and beat her breast and comely face more that she did before. Then the old woman enquired the causes of her new and sudden lamentation. The maiden, sighing in pitiful sort, answered her: “Alas, now I am utterly undone, now am I out of all hope! O give me a knife to kill me, or a halter to hang me.” at this the old woman became angry and harshly commanded her to tell her the cause of her sorrow and why, after her sleep, she should renew her grief and miserable weeping. She said: “What, do you intend to deprive our young men of the price of your ransom? No, no! Cease your crying, for the thieves little esteem your howling. And if you do not, I will surely burn you alive.” <br><br>
[26] At this the maiden was greatly afraid, and kissed her hand and said, “O mother, take pity on me and my wretched fortune, and give me license a while to speak, for I think I shall not long live. Let there be mercy ripe and true in your venerable white head, and hear the sum of my calamity. <br><br>
“There was a handsome young man, who for his bounty and grace was beloved entirely by all the town, my cousin, and but three years older than I; we two were nourished and brought up in one house, lay under one roof, and in one chamber, and at length by promise of marriage, and by consent of our parents we were contracted together. The marriage day was come, the house was garnished with laurel, and torches were set in every place in the honor of Hymeneus, my espouse was accompanied by his parents, kinsfolk, and friends, and made sacrifices in the temples and public places. And when my unhappy mother pampered me in her lap, and decked me like a bride, kissing me sweetly, and making me a parent for children, behold there came in a great multitude of thieves armed like men of war, with naked swords in their hands, who went not about to do any harm, neither to take any thing away, but broke into the chamber where I was, and violently took me out of my mother’s arms, when none of our family would resist for fear. In this sort was our marriage disturbed, like the marriage of Atthis and Protesilaus. <br><br>
[27] “But behold my good mother, now my unhappy fortune is renewed and increased: For I dreamed in my sleep, that I was pulled out of our house, out of our chamber, and out of my bed, and that I taken to solitary and unknown places, calling upon the name of my unfortunate husband, and how that he, as soon as he perceived that he was taken away, even smelling with perfumes and crowned with garlands, did trace me by the steps, desiring the aid of the people to assist him, in that his wife was violently stolen away, and as he went crying up and down, one of the thieves moved with indignation, by reason of his pursuit, took up a stone that lay at his feet, and threw it at my husband and killed him. By the terror of which sight, and the fear of so dreadful a dream, I awaked.” <br><br>
Then the old woman rendering out like sighs, began to speak in this sort: “My daughter take a good heart to you, and bee not afraid at feigned and strange visions and dreams, for as the visions of the day are accounted false and untrue, so the visions of the night do often change contrary. And to dream of weeping, beating, and killing, is a token of good luck and prosperous change. Whereas to dream of laughing, carnal dalliance, and good cheer, is a sign of sadness, sickness, loss of substance, and displeasure. But I will tell you a pleasant tale, to put away all your sorrow, and to revive your spirits.” And so she began in this manner. <br><br>
THE TALE OF CUPID AND PSYCHE <br><br>
[28] “There was sometimes a certain king, inhabiting in the west parts, who had to wife a noble dame, by whom he had three daughters exceeding fair: of whom the two elder were of such comely shape and beauty, as they did excel and pass all other women living, whereby they were thought worthily to deserve the praise and commendation of every person, and deservedly to be preferred above the residue of the common sort. Yet the singular passing beauty and maidenly majesty of the youngest daughter did so far surmount and excel the other two, as no earthly creature could by any means sufficiently express or set out the same. <br><br>
“By reason whereof, after the fame of this excellent maiden was spread about in every part of the city, the citizens and strangers there being inwardly pricked by the zealous affection to behold her famous person, came daily by thousands, hundreds, and scores, to her father’s palace, who was astonished with admiration of her incomparable beauty, did no less worship and reverence her with crosses, signs, and tokens, and other divine adorations, according to the custom of the old used rites and ceremonies, than if she were the Lady Venus indeed, and shortly after the fame was spread into the next cities and bordering regions, that the goddess whom the deep seas had born and brought forth, and the froth of the waves had nourished, to the intent to show her high magnificence and divine power on earth, to such as once did honor and worship her, was now conversant among mortal men, or else that the earth and not the sea, by a new concourse and influence of the celestial planets, had budded and yielded forth a new Venus, endued with the flower of virginity. <br><br>
[29] So daily more and more increased this opinion, and now is her flying fame dispersed into the next island, and well nigh to every part and province of the whole world. Whereupon innumerable strangers came from far countries, adventuring themselves by long journeys on land and by great perils on water, to behold this glorious virgin. By occasion whereof such a contempt grew towards the goddess Venus, that no person traveled to the town Paphos, nor to the Isle Cnidos, nor to Cythera to worship her. Her ornaments were thrown out, her temples defaced, her pillows and cushions torn, her ceremonies neglected, her images and statues uncrowned, and her bare altars unswept and foul with the ashes of old burnt sacrifice. For every person honored and worshipped this maiden in stead of Venus, and in the morning at her first coming abroad offered to her oblations, provided banquets, called her by the name of Venus, who was not Venus indeed, and in her honor presented flowers and garlands in most reverend fashion. <br><br>
This sudden change and alteration of celestial honor, did greatly inflame and kindle the heart of very Venus, who, unable to temper her self from indignation, shaking her head in raging sort, reasoned with her self in this manner: <br><br>
[30] “Behold the original parent of all these elements, behold the Lady Venus renowned throughout all the world, with whom a mortal maiden is joined now as partaker of honor: my name registered in the city of heaven is profaned and made vile by earthly absurdities. If I shall suffer any mortal creature to present my Majesty on earth, or that any shall bear about a false surmised shape of her person, then in vain did Paris the shepherd (in whose judgment and competence the great Jupiter had confidence) prefer me above the residue of the goddesses, for the excellence of my beauty: but she, whatever she be that has usurped my honor, shall shortly repent her of her unlawful condition.” And by and by she called her winged son Cupid, rash enough and hardy, who by his evil manners despising all public justice and law, armed with fire and arrows, running up and down in the nights from house to house, and corrupting the lawful marriages of every person, does nothing but that which is evil, who, although that he were of his own proper nature sufficiently prone to work mischief, yet she egged him forward with words and brought him to the city, and showed him Psyche (for so the maid was called) and having told the cause of her anger, not without great rage, said:<br><br>
[31] “‘I pray you my dear child, by motherly bond of love, by the sweet wounds of your piercing darts, by the pleasant heat of your fire, revenge the injury which is done to your mother by the false and disobedient beauty of a mortal maiden, and I pray you, that without delay she may fall in love with the most miserable creature living, the most poor, the most crooked, and the most vile, that there may be none found in all the world of like wretchedness.’ When she had spoken these words she embraced and kissed her son, and took her voyage toward the sea. <br><br>
“When she came upon the sea she began to call the gods and goddesses, who were obedient at her voice. For incontinent came the daughters of Nereus, singing with tunes melodiously: Portunus with his bristled and rough beard, Salicia with her bosom full of fish, Palaemon the driver of the dolphin, the trumpeters of Triton, leaping hither and thither, and blowing with heavenly noise: such was the company which followed Venus, marching towards the ocean sea. <br><br>
[32] “In the meantime Psyche, with all her beauty, received no fruit of honor. She was wondered at of all, she was praised of all, but she perceived that no king nor prince, nor any one of the superior sort did repair to woo her. Every one marveled at her divine beauty, as it were some image well painted and set out. Her other two sisters, who were not so greatly exalted by the people, were royally married to two kings: but the virgin Psyche, sitting alone at home, lamented her solitary life, and being disquieted both in mind and body, although she pleased all the world, yet hated she in her self her own beauty. Whereupon the miserable father of this unfortunate daughter, suspecting that the gods and powers of heaven did envy her condition, went to the town called Miletus to receive the Oracle of Apollo, where he made his prayers and offered sacrifice, and desired a husband for his daughter. But Apollo, though he was a Greek, and of the country of Ionia, because of the foundation of Miletus, yet he gave answer in Latin verse, the sense whereof was this:<br><br>
[33] “‘Let Psyche’s body be clad in mourning wed,<br>
And set on rock of yonder hill aloft:<br>
Her husband is no being of human seed,<br>
But serpent dire and fierce as might be thought.<br>
Who flies with wings above in starry skies,<br>
And doth subdue each thing with fiery flight.<br>
The gods themselves, and powers that seem so wise,<br>
With mighty Jove, be subject to his might,<br>
The rivers black, and deadly floods of pain<br>
And darkness eke, as thrall to him remain.’<br><br>
“The king, before happy, when he heard the prophecy of Apollo, returned home sad and sorrowful, and declared to his wife the miserable and unhappy fate of his daughter. Then they began to lament and weep, and passed over many days in great sorrow. But now the time approached of Psyche’s marriage, preparation was made, black torches were lighted, the pleasant songs were turned into pitiful cries, the melody of Hymeneus was ended with deadly howling, the maid that should be married did wipe her eyes with her veil. All the family and people of the city wept likewise, and with great lamentation was ordained a remiss time for that day, <br><br>
[34] “But necessity compelled that Psyche should be brought to her appointed place, according to the divine appointment. And when the solemnity was ended, they went to bring the sorrowful spouse, not to her marriage, but to her final end and burial. And while the father and mother of Psyche did go forward weeping and crying to this enterprise, Psyches spoke to them in this sort: ‘Why torment your unhappy age with continual grief? Why trouble you your spirits, which are more rather mine than yours? Why do you soil your faces with tears, which I ought to adore and worship? Why do you grieve my eyes in yours? why pull you your white hairs? Why do you beat your breasts for me? Now you see the reward of my excellent beauty: now, now you perceive, but too late, the plague of envy. When the people did honor me, and call me new Venus, then you should have wept, then you should have sorrowed as though I had been dead: for now I see and perceive that I have come to this misery by the only name of Venus. Bring me, and as fortune has appointed, place me on the top of the rock, I greatly desire to end my marriage, I greatly covet to see my husband. Why do I delay? why should I refuse him who is appointed to destroy all the world.’ <br><br>
[35] “Thus she ended her words, and thrust her self among the people that followed. Then they brought her to the appointed rock of the high hill, and set her thereon, and so departed. The torches and lights were put out with the tears of the people, and every man gone home, the miserable parents well nigh consumed with sorrow, gave themselves to everlasting darkness. <br><br>
“Thus poor Psyche, being left alone, weeping and trembling on the top of the rock, was blown by the gentle air and of shrilling Zephyrus, and carried from the hill with a meek wind, which retained her garments up, and by little and little bought her down into a deep valley, where she was laid in a bed of most sweet and fragrant flowers.” <br><br>
