<b>Apuleius, <i>The Golden Ass</i> Book VII</b><br><br>
[1] As soon as night was past and the clear chariot of the sun had spread his bright beams on every coast, one of the company of the thieves came (for so his and their greeting together did declare) who, at the first entry into the cave (after he had rested himself, and was able to speak), told these tidings to his companions in this sort. “Sirs, regarding the house of Milo of Hypata, which we forcibly entered and ransacked yesterday, we may put away all fear and doubt. For after you, by force of arms, had spoiled and taken away all things in the house, and returned hither into our cave, I (thrusting my self amongst the press of the people, and showing myself as though I was sad and sorrowful for the mischance) consulted with them as to the investigation of the matter, and as to what means were being wrought for the apprehension of the thieves, so that I might learn and see all that was going to be done about you (as you willed me). The whole deed was at length, by manifest and evident proofs, and also by the common opinion and judgment of the people, attributed to one Lucius, charged as manifest author of this common robbery. He, a few days before, by false and forged letters and colored honesty, fell so far in favor with this Milo that he was entertained in his house and received as a chief of his familiar friends. This Lucius, after that he had sojourned there a good space and won the heart of Milo’s maid by feigned love, thoroughly learned the ways and doors of all the house, and curiously viewed the coffers and chests, where the whole substance of Milo was stored. <br><br>
[2] “Neither was there small cause given to judge him guilty, since the very same night when this robbery occurred he fled away and could not be found anywhere. So that he might cleanly escape and better prevent such hue and cry made after him, he took his white horse and galloped away. After this, his servant was found in the house who (accused as accessory to the felony and escape of his master) was committed to the common jail. And the next day he was cruelly scourged and tormented till he was nearly dead, so that he would confess the matter. But when they could wrest or learn nothing from him, they sent many persons afterwards to Lucius’ country to inquire about him, and so to take him prisoner.” As he declared these things, I greatly lamented with myself, to think of my former, having being changed into a miserable ass. Then I had no small occasion to remember how the ancient writers used to affirm that fortune was stark blind and without eyes, because she always bestows her riches upon evil persons, and fools, and chooses or favors no mortal person by judgment, but is always conversant with those she should most shun (especially if she could see). And what is worse, she shows such evil or contrary opinions in men, so that the wicked glory in the name of good, and the good and innocent are detracted and slandered as evil. <br><br>
[3] Furthermore I, who by fortune’s great cruelty was turned into a four-footed ass in most vile and abject manner, and whose condition seemed worthily to be lamented and pitied by the most hard and stony hearts, was accused of theft and robbing of my dear host Milo. This villainy might rather be called parricide then theft, yet I could not defend my own cause or deny the deed in any way because I could not speak. However, at least my conscience seemed to accuse me by reason of silence, and again being forced by impatience I endeavored to speak, and would have said, “I never did that deed,” and indeed I said the first word “Never” once or twice somewhat handsomely, but the rest I could not pronounce. But still, remaining in one voice, I cried, “Never, never, never.” However, I shaped my hanging lips as round as I could to as to say the rest. But why should I further complain of the cruelty of my fortune, since I was not totally unhappy, because my servant and my horse were likewise accused with me of the robbery. <br><br>
[4] While I pondered all these things, I remembered with great distress the death sentence that the thieves had devised for me and the maiden. And still, as I looked down at my belly, I thought of my poor gentlewoman who would be closed within me. The thief who a little before had brought the false charges against me drew out of the skirt of his coat a thousand gold pieces which he had rifled from those he met, and brought it into the common treasury. Then he carefully enquired how the rest of his companions were. It was declared to him that the most valiant had been murdered and slain in various ways. Whereupon he persuaded them to remit all their affairs a little while, and to seek others to fill their places, so that by the exercise of new lads, the terror of their martial band might be increased to the old number. He assured them that those who were unwilling might be compelled by menaces and threats, and those who were willing might be encouraged with rewards. Further, he said that there were some, who (seeing the profit that they had) would forsake their base and servile condition, and would rather be contented to live like tyrants amongst them. Moreover, he declared that for his part he had spoken with a certain tall man, a valiant companion, but of young age, stout in body, and courageous at fighting. He said that he had fully persuaded this young man to exercise his idle hands, which had become dull with slothfulness, to his greater profit, and (while he might) in order to receive the bliss of better fortune. He was urged not to hold out his sturdy arm to beg for a penny, but rather to take as much gold and silver as he could. <br><br>
[5] Then everyone consented that he that seemed worthy to be their companion, and that they would search for others to make up the rest of the number. Whereupon the thief went out, and by and by (returning again) brought in a tall young man (as he promised) to whom none of the rest could be compared. For he was taller than them by the head and of greater size in body. His beard was just beginning to grow, but he was poorly appareled, such that you might see all his belly naked. As soon as he entered in he said, “God speed to you soldiers of Mars and my faithful companions, I pray you make me one of your band, and I will ensure you that you shall have a man of singular courage and lively audacity. For I would rather receive a whipping upon my back, than money or gold in my hands. And, as for death (which every man fears), I care nothing at all. Yet do not think that I am an abject or a beggar, nor judge my virtue and prowess by my ragged clothes. I have been a captain of a great company, and subdued all the country of Macedonia. I am the renowned thief Haemus the Thracian, whose name all countries and nations greatly fear. I am the son of Theron the noble thief, nourished with human blood, entertained amongst the stoutest men, Finally I am inheritor and follower of all my father’s virtues. <br><br>
[6] “Yet I lost in a short time all my company and all my riches in one assault that I made upon a officer of the emperor. For fortune was clean against me. Hearken and I will tell you the whole matter. There was a certain man in the court of the emperor who had many offices, and was in great favor, who at last, on account of the envy of various persons, was banished and compelled to forsake the court. His wife Plotina, a woman of rare faith and singular modesty, having borne ten children to her husband, despised all worldly pomp and delicacy and determined to follow her husband, and to share his perils and danger. Wherefore she cut off her hair, disguised herself like a man, and took with her all her treasure, passing through the hands of the soldiers and naked swords without any fear. Whereby she endured many miseries, and was partaker of much affliction, in order to save the life of her husband. Such was the love which she bore for him. And when they had escaped many perilous dangers, by land as well as by sea, they went together towards Zacynthus, to continue there according to what fortune had appointed. <br><br>
[7] “But when they arrived on the sea coast of Actium (where we in our return from Macedon were roving about), when night came, they returned to a house not far distant from their ship, where they lain all night. Then we entered and took away all their substance, but verily we were in great danger. For the good matron, perceiving us swiftly by the noise of the gate, went into the chamber and called up every man by his name, and likewise the neighbors who were living round about. Thusly, because of the fear that everyone was in, we hardly escaped. But this most holy woman, faithful and true to her husband (as the truth must be declared), returned to Caesar, asking for his aid and authority and demanding vengeance for the injury done to her husband. He granted all her desire. Then my company went to ruin, in that every man was slain. So great was the authority and word of the emperor. However, when all my band was lost and taken by search of the emperor’s army, I alone stole away and saved myself from the violence of the soldiers. <br><br>
[8] “For I clothed myself in a woman’s attire, and mounted upon an ass that was carrying barley sheaves, and passing through the middle of them all I escaped, because everyone deemed that I was a woman because I lacked a beard. However, I did not leave off for all this, nor did I degenerate from the glory of my father or from my own virtue. But freshly coming from the bloody skirmish and disguised like a woman, I invaded towns and castles alone to get some spoils.” And thereupon he pulled out two thousand gold pieces which he had under his coat, saying, “Hold here the dowry which I present to you, hold also my person, which you shall always find trusty and faithful, if you willingly receive me. And I will ensure you that in so doing, within a short space, I will turn this stony house of yours into gold.” <br><br>
[9] Then by and by every one consented to make him their captain, and so they gave him better garments, and threw away his old ones. When they had changed his attire, he embraced them one after another, then they sat him in the place of honor at the table, and drank to him in token of good luck. After supper they began to talk and declare to him the attempted escape of the gentlewoman, and how I bore her upon my back, and what death was ordained for us two. Then he asked to see her, whereupon the gentlewoman was brought forth, bound fast. As soon as he beheld her, he turned away wringing his nose and blamed them, saying, “I am not so much a beast or so rash a fellow to drive you from your purpose, but my conscience will not suffer me to conceal anything that pertains to your profit, since I am careful for you. However, if my counsel displeases you, you may at your liberty proceed in your enterprise. I do not doubt that all thieves, and those who have a good judgment, will prefer their own advantage and gain above all things in the world, even above vengeance, which purchases damage to various persons. Therefore if you put this virgin in the ass’ belly, you shall but execute your indignation against her, without any manner of profit. But I would advise you to carry the virgin to some town and sell her. Since she is such a brave girl, she may be sold for a great quantity of money. I myself know certain bawdy merchants, amongst whom surely one will give us sums of gold for her. This is my opinion regarding this affair. But decide what you intend to do, for you may overrule me in this case.” <br><br>
[10] In this manner the good thief pleaded and defended our cause, being a good patron to the silly virgin, and to me, poor ass. They deliberated on the matter for a long time, which made my heart (God knows) and spirit greatly afraid. However, in the end they consented to his opinion, and by and by the maiden was unloosed of her bonds. She, seeing the young man and hearing the name of brothels and bawdy merchants, began to wax joyful, and smiled to herself. Then I began to think evil of the generation of women when as I saw the maiden (who was appointed to be married to a young gentleman and who so greatly desired him) was now delighted with the talk of a wicked brothel house, and other things dishonest. In this way the consent and manners of women depended in the judgment of an ass. Then the young man spoke again, saying, “Masters, why do we not go about making our prayers to Mars regarding the selling of the maiden, and to seek for other companions? But as far as I see, there is no beast to make sacrifice with, nor wine sufficient for us to drink. Let me have ten men, and we will go to the next castle to get food and other things necessary.” So he and ten men went their way. In the meantime the rest made a great fire and an altar of green turf in the honor of Mars. <br><br>
[11] By and by after they came back again, bringing with them bottles of wine and a great number of beasts. Among the beasts there was a big ram goat, fat, old, and hairy, which they killed and offered to Mars. Then supper was prepared sumptuously, and the new companion said to the others, “You ought to count me not only your captain in robbery and fight, but also in pleasures and jollity.” Whereupon with pleasant cheer he prepared food and, trimming up the house, he set all things in order, and brought the pottage and dainty dishes to the table. But above all he plied them well with great pots and jugs of wine. Sometimes (seeming to fetch some more) he would go to the maiden and give her pieces of meat, which he had secretly taken, and give her drink, which she willingly took in good part. Moreover, he kissed her twice or thrice for which she was well pleased. But I (unhappy at this) thought to myself: “O wretched maid, you have forgotten your marriage, and esteem this stranger and bloody thief above your husband, whom your parents ordained for thee. Now I perceive well that you have no remorse in your conscience, but rather delight to tarry and play the harlot hear amongst so many swords. What? Do you not know how the other thieves, if they knew your demeanor, would put you to death as they had once decided, and so work my destruction likewise? Well now, I perceive you take pleasure in the damage and hurt of others.” <br><br>
[12] While I angrily devised all these things, I perceived that, by certain signs and tokens (not ignorant to so wise an ass), he was not the notable thief Haemus, but rather Tlepolemus her husband. After much conversation he began to speak more frankly, not fearing at all my presence, and said, “Be of good cheer my sweet girl Charite, for you shall soon have all your enemies as captives. Then he filled wine for the thieves more and more, and never ceased till they were all overcome with abundance of food and drink. He, on the other hand, abstained and bridled his own appetite. And truly I did greatly suspect that he had mingled in their cups some powerful poison, for quickly they all fell down asleep on the ground one after an other, and lay as though they were dead. When the thieves were all asleep by their great and immoderate drinking, the young man Tlepolemus took the maiden and set her upon my back, and went homeward. <br><br>
[13] When we had come home, all the people of the city, especially her parents, friends, and family, came running forth joyfully, and the children and maidens of the town gathered together to see this virgin in great triumph sitting upon an ass. Then I (willing to show as much joy as I could in present occasion) pricked up my long ears, rattled my nostrils, and cried stoutly. Nay rather I made the town echo with my shrilling sound. When we came to her father’s house, she was received in a chamber honorably. As for me, Tlepolemus (accompanied with a great number of citizens) presently drove me back again with other horses to the cave of the thieves, where we found them all asleep lying on the ground as we left them. The citizens first brought out all the gold and silver and other treasure of the house, and loaded us with it. When they had done this, they threw many of the thieves down into the bottom of deep ditches, and the rest they slew with their swords. After this we returned home glad and merry because of so great vengeance upon them, and the riches which we carried was committed to the public treasury. This done, the maid was married to Tlepolemus, according to the law, whom by so much travail he had valiantly recovered. <br><br>
[14] Then my good mistress looked about for me and, asking for me, commanded on the very same day of her marriage that my manger should be filled with barley, and that I should have hay and oats abundantly, and she would call me her little camel. But how greatly did I curse Fotis, in that she transformed me into an ass and not into a dog, because I saw the dogs had filled their paunches with the remains and bones of so worthy a supper. The next day this new wedded woman (my mistress) greatly commended me before her parents and husband for the kindness I had shown her, and never left off until they promised to reward me with great honors. Then they called together all their friends, and thus it was concluded: one said that I should be closed in a stable and never work, but continually be fed and fatted with fine and chosen barley and beans and good litter. However another prevailed who, wishing my liberty, persuaded them that it was better for me to run in the fields amongst the lascivious horses and mares, whereby I might engender some mules for my mistress. <br><br>
[15] Then the man who was in charge of keeping the horses was called for, and I was delivered to him with great care. I was very happy and joyous because I thought that I would carry no more packs or burdens. Moreover I thought that, when I should thus be at liberty, in the spring time of the year, when the meadows and fields were green, I should find some roses in some place. Thus I was fully persuaded that, if my master and mistress rendered me so many thanks and honors when I was an ass, they would much more reward me when I would be turned into a man. But when he (to whom the charge of me was so straightly committed) had brought me a good way distant from the city, I perceived that no delicate food or liberty was in store for me, but by and by his covetous wife and most cursed mistress made me a mill ass, and (beating me with a cudgel full of knots) would wring bread for herself and her husband out of my skin. Yet was she not contented to weary me and make me a drudge with carriage and grinding of her own corn, but I was hired out to her neighbors to bear their sacks likewise. However she would not give me such food as I needed, nor sufficient to sustain my life. The barley that I ground for my own dinner she would sell to the villagers nearby. And after I had labored all day, she would set before me at night a little filthy bran, not clean but full of stones. <br><br>
[16] While I was afflicted with this calamity, fortune worked for me other torments. One day I was let loose into the fields to pasture by the command of my master. How I leapt for joy, how I neighed to see my self in such liberty, especially since I beheld so many mares who I thought would be my wives and concubines. I discerned and chose the fairest before I came near them. But my joyful hope turned into utter destruction, for swiftly all the male horses, who were well fed and made strong by ease of pasture and thereby much more powerful then a poor ass, became jealous of me, and (having no regard to the law and order of Jupiter) ran fiercely and terribly at me. One lifted up his forefeet and kicked me spitefully, another turned himself, and with his hind heels struck me cruelly, the third, threatening with a malicious neighing, dressed his ears and, showing his sharp and white teeth, bit me on every side. In similar sort have I read in Histories how the king of Thrace would throw his miserable guests to be torn in pieces and devoured by his wild horses. So ungenerous was that tyrant of his provender, that he nourished them with the bodies of men. <br><br>
[17] After I was thus handled by horses, I was brought home again to the mill, but behold, fortune (insatiable of my torments) had devised a new pain for me. I was appointed to bring home wood every day from a high hill, and who should drive me thither and home again but a boy that was the worst tormentor in all the world. He was not content with the great travail that I took in climbing up the hill, nor was he pleased when he saw my hoof torn and worn away by sharp stones, but he beat me cruelly with a great staff, so much so that the marrow of my bones ached for woe. He would strike me continually on the right hip in the same place, whereby he tore my skin and made my wide sore into a great hole or trench, or rather a window to look out at. Although it ran down blood, he would not cease beating me in that place. Moreover he loaded me with such great burdens of wood that you would think they had been rather prepared for elephants rather than for me. And when he perceived that my wood hung more on one side than the other, instead of taking away the heavy sides, and so ease me, or else lift them up to make them equal with the other, he laid great stones upon the weaker side to remedy the matter. <br><br>
[18] Yet he could not be contented with my great misery and immoderate burdens of wood, but when he came to any river (as there were many by the way) he, to save his feet from water, would leap upon my loins likewise, which was no small load. And if by adversity I fell down in any dirty or muddy place, when he could have pulled me out either with ropes, or lifted me up by the tail, he would never help me but he would beat me from head to toe with a mighty staff till there was no hair left on all my body, not even on my ears. Thus I was compelled by force of blows to stand up. The same wicked boy invented another torment for me: he gathered a great many sharp thorns, as sharp as needles, and bound them together like a bundle, and tied them to my tail to prick me. <br><br>
[19] Then was I afflicted on every side, for if I endeavored to run away, the thorns would prick me. If I had stood still, the boy would beat me, and yet the boy beat me to make me run, whereby I perceived that the wretch devised nothing else except to kill me by some means, and he would swear and threaten to do me worse harm. And because he might have some occasion to execute his malicious intent, one day (after I had suffered too much at his hands) I lifted up my heels and struck him stoutly. Then he devised this vengeance against me: after that he had well loaded me with shrubs and rubble, and trussed it round upon my back, he brought me out into the road. Then he stole a burning coal out of a man’s house in the next village, and put it into the middle of the rubble. The rubble and shrubs were very dry, and caught fire and burned me on every side. I could see no remedy how I might save myself, and in any a case it was not best for me to stand still <br><br>
[20] But fortune was favorable towards me, perhaps to reserve me for more dangers, for I saw a great hole full of rainwater that had fallen the day before. I ran there hastily and plunged myself in the water so that I quenched the fire, and was saved from that present peril. But the vile boy, to excuse himself, declared to all the neighbors and shepherds about that I willingly tumbled in the fire as I passed through the village. Then he laughed at me saying: “How long shall we nourish and keep this fiery ass in vain?” A few days after, the boy invented another mischief. For when he had sold all the wood which I bore to certain men dwelling in a village nearby, he led me homeward unloaded. And then he cried that he was not able to manage me, and that he would not drive me any longer to the hill for wood, saying:<br><br>
[21] “Do you not see this slow and dull ass who, besides all the mischief that he has wrought already, invents daily more and more. For if he espies any woman passing by the way, whether she is old or married or if she is a young child, he will throw his burden from his back, and run fiercely upon them. And after he has thrown them down, he will stride over them to commit his buggery and beastly pleasure. Moreover he will pretend to would kiss them, but he will bite their faces cruelly. This may cause us great displeasure, or rather to be imputed to us as a crime. And even now, when he saw an honest maiden passing by the highway, he by and by threw down his wood and ran after her. And when he had thrown her down upon the ground, he would have ravished her before the face of all the world, had it not been that, by reason of her crying out, she was succored and pulled from his heels, and so saved. And if it had so come to pass that this fearful maid had been slain by him, what danger would we have been in?” <br><br>
[22] By these and like lies, he provoked the shepherds earnestly against me. It grieved me (God knows) sorely that I could say nothing. Then one of the shepherds said: “Why do we not make sacrifice of this common adulterous ass? My son, let us kill him and throw his guts to the dogs, and reserve his flesh for the laborers’ supper. Then let us cast dust upon his skin, and carry it home to our master, and say that the wolves have devoured him.” The boy who was my evil accuser made no delay, but prepared himself to execute the sentence of the shepherd, rejoicing at my present danger. But O how greatly did I then repent that the blow which I gave him with my heel had not killed him. He drew out his sword and made it sharp upon the whetstone to slay me, but another of the shepherds began to say:<br><br>
[23] “Verily it is a great offence to kill so fair an ass, and so (even though he is accused of luxury and lascivious wantonness) to lack his necessary labor and service. But if you cut off his testicles, he might not only be deprived of his courage but also become gentle, and we should be delivered from all fear and danger. Moreover he would be thereby fatter and better in flesh. For I know myself that many asses, just as is the case with very spirited horses, by reason of their wantonness become most mad and terrible, but (when they were gelded and cut) they have become gentle and tame, and tractable to all use. Wherefore I would counsel you to geld him. And if you consent to this, I will by and by, when I go to the next market, fetch my irons and tools for the purpose. And I ensure you that, after that I have gelded and cut off his testicles, I will deliver him to you as tame as a lamb.” <br><br>
[24] When I perceived that I had been saved from death and reserved to be gelded, I was greatly sorry, and I thought that all the hind part of my body and my testicles ached for woe. And so I sought to kill myself by some means so that, if I should die, I would die with intact members. While I devised how I might end my life, the vile boy on the next morning led me to the same hill again, and tied me to a bough of a great oak. In the meantime he took his hatchet and cut wood to load me with. But behold there crept out of a cave nearby a marvelous great bear, holding out his mighty head. When I saw it, I was suddenly struck with fear, and (throwing all the strength of my body into my hind heels) lifted up my strained head and broke the halter with which I was tied. Then there was no need to bid me to run away, for I scoured not only on foot, but tumbled over the stones and rocks with my body till I came to the open fields so I could escape from the terrible bear, but especially from the boy who was worse than the bear. <br><br>
[25] Then a certain stranger that passed by the way (discerning me alone as a stray ass) took me up and rode upon my back, beating me with a staff (which he bore in his hand) through a wide and unknown lane. I was not displeased at this, but willingly went forward to avoid the cruel pain of gelding, which the shepherds had ordained for me. As for the beating, I was not moved since I was accustomed to be beaten so every day. But evil fortune would not suffer me to continue in so good a condition for long: For the shepherds, looking about for a cow that they had lost (after they had sought it in various places) happened to come upon us unawares. When they saw and knew me, they would have taken me by the halter. But the man who rode upon my back resisted them saying, “O Lord masters, what do you intend to do? Will you rob me?” Then the shepherds said, “What? Do you think that we handle you otherwise than you deserve, you who have stolen away our ass? Why do you not tell us where your have hidden the boy whom you have slain?” And thereupon they pulled him down to the ground and beat him with their fists and kicked him with their feet. Then he answered them saying that he saw no boy, but only found the ass loose and straying abroad, which he took up so as to have some reward for the finding of him and to restore him again to his master. “And I would to God,” said he, “that this ass (whom I wish I had never seen) could speak as a man to give witness to my innocence. Then would you be ashamed of the injury that you have done to me.” Thus (reasoning for himself) he did not prevail, for they tied the halter about my neck, and pulled me quite away, and led me back again through the woods of the hill to the place where the boy accustomed to resort. <br><br>
[26] They could find him in nowhere at first, but at length they found his body rent and torn in pieces, and his members dispersed in sundry places, This deed I well knew had been done by the cruel bear. And verily I would have told them so if I could have spoken, but (which I could only do) I greatly rejoiced at his death, although it came too late. Then they gathered together the pieces of his body and buried them. By and by they laid the fault to my new master who had taken me up by the road, and (bringing him home, bound fast, to their houses) purposed on the next day to accuse him of murder, and to lead him before the justices to have judgment of death. <br><br>
In the meantime, while the parents of the boy lamented and wept for the death of their son, the shepherd (according to his promise) came with his instruments and tools to geld me. Then one of them said, “Bah! We little esteem the mischief he did yesterday, but now we are contented that tomorrow not only his testicles shall be cut off, but also his head.” <br><br>
[27] So was it brought to pass that my death was delayed till the next morning. O but what thanks did I give to that good boy, who (being so slain) was the cause of my pardon for one short day. However, I had no time then to rest myself, for the mother of the boy, weeping and lamenting for his death, attired in mourning vesture, tore her hair and beat her breast, and came presently into the stable, saying, “Is it right that this careless beast should do nothing all day but hold his head in the manger, filling his guts with food, without compassion for my great misery, or remembrance of the pitiful death of his slain master? And, despising my age and infirmity, he thinks that I am unable to revenge his mischief. Moreover he would persuade me that he was not culpable. Indeed, it is a convenient thing to look and plead for safety when the conscience confesses the offence, as thieves and malefactors are accustomed to do. But, O good Lord, you cursed beast, if you could utter the contents of you mind, whom (though it were the truest fool in all the world) could you persuade that this murder was not your fault? Did it not lay in your power either to keep off the thieves with your heels, or else to bite and tear them with your teeth? Could you not (who so often in his life time struck and kicked him) defend him now at the point of death in the same way? Yet at least, your should have taken him upon your back, and so brought him from the cruel hands of the thieves. But instead you ran away alone, forsaking your good master, your pastor and conductor. Don’t you know that those who deny their wholesome help and aid to those who lie in danger of death ought to be punished? This is because they have offended against good manners and natural law! But I promise you, you shall not long rejoice at my grief, you shall feel the pain of your homicide and offence. I will see what I can do.” <br><br>
[28] And thereupon she took off her apron, and bound all my feet together so that I might not help myself. Then she took a great bar, which accustomed to bar the stable door, and never ceased beating me till she was so weary that the bar fell out of her hands. Whereupon she (complaining of that her arms became faint too soon) ran to her fire and brought a firebrand and thrust it under my tail, burning me continually, till such time as I (having but one remedy) arrayed her face and eyes with my dirty dung. Whereby (what with the stink thereof, and what with the filth that fell in her eyes) she was nearly blinded. So I forced the woman to leave off, otherwise I might have died as Meleager did by the stick which his mad mother Althea cast into the fire. <br><br>
