<b>Apuleius, <i>The Golden Ass</i> Book VIII</b><br><br>
[1] About midnight came a young man who seemed to be one of the family of the good woman Charite (who once endured so much misery and calamity with me amongst the thieves). After he had taken a stool and sat down before the fire in the company of the servants, he began to declare many terrible things that had happened to the house of Charite, saying: “O you house-keepers, shepherds and cowherds, understand that we have lost our good mistress Charite miserably and by evil adventure. And so that you may learn and know the whole matter, I intend to tell you the circumstances point by point, so that those who are more learned than I (to whom fortune has give more copious style) may write it out in paper in form of a History. There was a young gentleman dwelling in the next city, born of good parentage, valiant in prowess, and rich in substance, but very much given and addicted to whoring and continual reveling. He fell in company with thieves and was eager for the shedding of human blood. His name was Thrasyllus. His character was thus according to the report of every man. <br><br>
[2] “He demanded Charite in marriage and, although he was a man more comely then the rest of those who wooed her, and also had riches abundantly, yet because he had a bad reputation and was a man of wicked manners and conversation, he was repulsed and put off by Charite. And so she married Tlepolemus. However this young man secretly loved her, even though he was offended somewhat by her refusal, and he busily searched some means to work his damnable intent. And (having found occasion and opportunity to accomplish the purpose which he had long time concealed) he brought it to pass that on the same day Charite was saved by the subtle means and valiant audacity of her husband from the captivity of the thieves, he mingled himself among the assembly, and pretended that he was glad of the new marriage and the return of the maiden. Whereby (since he came of such noble parents) he was received and entertained in the house as one of their chief and principal friends. However, under the guise of a faithful well-wisher, he concealed his mischievous mind and intent. Subsequently by much familiarity and by frequent conversation and banqueting together, he fell more and more in favor. This is what happens to lovers who first little delight themselves in love, but by continual acquaintance they kiss and embrace each other. <br><br>
[3] “Thrasyllus perceived that it was a hard matter to disclose his thoughts secretly to Charite, and so was wholly barred from the accomplishment of his luxurious desire. On the other hand, he perceived that the love between her and her husband was so strong that the bond between them might in no way be severed. On this ground too he understood that it was impossible to ravish her. Although he knew all this, he was still provoked forward by vehement lust. At length the thing which seemed so hard and difficult, through hope of his fortified love, now appeared easy and simple. But mark, I pray you, diligently what end the furious force of his inordinate desire came to. <br><br>
[4] “One day Tlepolemus went hunting with Thrasyllus for goats (goats, because his wife Charites desired him earnestly to meddle with no other beasts which were more fierce and wild by nature). When during the chase they came to a great thicket surrounded with briars and thorns, they sent their dogs around it and beset every place with nets. By and by the sign was given to let the dogs loose. The dogs rushed in with such a cry that all the forest echoed with the noise. But behold, there leaped out no goat, nor deer, nor gentle hind, but a horrible and dangerous wild boar, hard and thick-skinned, bristling terribly with thorns, foaming at the mouth, grinding his teeth, and looking threateningly with fiery eyes. He tore and rent with his tusks the dogs that first set upon him, and then he ran right through the nets, and escaped away. When we saw the fury of this beast, we were greatly stricken with fear because we were not accustomed to chase such dreadful boars, and further because we were unarmed. <br><br>
[5] “And so we hid ourselves under bushes and trees. Then Thrasyllus, having found opportunity to work his treason, said to Tlepolemus: ‘What, do we stand here amazed? Why do we show ourselves like cowards? Why do we lose so worthy a prey because of our feminine hearts? Let us mount upon our horses and pursue him swiftly. Take a hunting staff, and I will take a chasing spear.’ By and by they leaped upon their horses and followed the beast. But the boar, returning against them with furious force, looked to see whom he might first assail with his tusks. Tlepolemus struck the beast first on the back with his hunting staff. Thrasyllus, pretending to aid and assist him, came behind, and cut off the hind legs of Tlepolemus’ horse so that he fell to the ground with his master. And suddenly the boar came upon Tlepolemus and furiously tore and rent him with his tusks. However, Thrasyllus was not content to see him thus wounded, but when he asked for help, he thrust Tlepolemus through the right thigh with his spear, because he thought the wound of the spear would be taken for a wound of the boar’s teeth. Then he killed the beast likewise. <br><br>
[6] “And when Tlepolemus was thus miserably slain, everyone of us came out of our holes and went towards our slain master. But although Thrasyllus was joyful for the death of Tlepolemus, whom he did greatly hate, yet he cloaked the matter with a sorrowful countenance and feigned a sad face. He often embraced the body which himself slew, he played all the parts of a mourning person, except no tears fell from his eyes. Thus he resembled us in each point, who verily and not without occasion had cause to lament for our master, and we laid all the blame for this homicide on the boar. Soon afterward the sorrowful news of the death of Tlepolemus came to the ears of all the family, but especially to Charite who, after she had heard such pitiful tidings, ran up and down the streets crying and howling lamentably like a madwoman. All the citizens gathered together, and whomever they met bore them company in running towards the scene. When they came to the slain body of Tlepolemus, Charite threw herself upon him weeping and lamenting grievously for his death, so that she would have presently ended her life upon the corpse of her slain husband, whom she so entirely loved, had it not been for her parents and friends who comforted her and pulled her away. The body was taken up and, in funeral pomp, was brought to the city and buried. <br><br>
[7] “In the meantime, Thrasyllus feigned much sorrow for the death of Tlepolemus, but in his heart he was well pleased and joyful. And to counterfeit the matter, he would come to Charite and say: ‘O what a loss I have had of my friend, my fellow, my companion Tlepolemus! O Charite, comfort your self, pacify your grief, refrain your weeping, do not beat your breasts.’ And with such and like words he endeavored to suppress her great sorrow. But he said these things not for any other reason than to win the heart of the woman, and to nourish his odious love with filthy delight. However Charite, after the burial of her husband, sought the means to follow him and (not enduring the sorrows she felt) went secretly into a chamber and intended to finish her life there with grief and tribulation. But Thrasyllus was very insistent and at length brought it to pass that, at the intercession of the parents and friends of Charite, she somewhat refreshed her fallen members with food and bath. However, she did it more at the command of her parents than for any thing else. For she could in no way be merry, or receive any comfort, but tormented herself day and night before the image of her husband which she made like unto Bacchus, and rendered to him divine honors and services. <br><br>
[8] “In the meantime Thrasyllus was not able to restrain himself any longer. He could not wait for Charite to assuage her grief, nor for her troubled mind to pacify her fury. Even in the middle of all her grief, while she tore her hair and rent her garments, he demanded her in marriage. Thusly, without shame, he revealed the secrets and unspeakable deceits of his heart. But Charite detested and abhorred his demand, and as though she had been stricken with some clap of thunder in some storm, or with the lightning of Jupiter, she presently fell down to the ground stunned. However, when her spirits were revived and she returned to herself, she, perceiving that Thrasyllus was so insistent, demanded respite to deliberate and to take advice on the matter. In the meantime, the shade of Tlepolemus, who had been slain so miserably, appeared to Charite saying, ‘O my sweet wife (a thing which no other person can say but I), I pray you by the love between us, if there is any memory of me in your heart, or remembrance of my pitiful death, marry anyone you like except the traitor Thrasyllus, and have no contact with him. Do not eat with him or lie with him. Avoid the bloody hand of my enemy, do not couple yourself with a parricide. For these wounds (the blood that your tears washed away) were not the wounds of the teeth of the boar. The spear of Thrasyllus took me from you.’ Thus spoke Tlepolemus to his loving wife, and he declared the rest of the damnable deed. <br><br>
[9] “Then Charite, awaking from sleep, began to renew her grief, to tear her garments, and to beat her arms with her comely hands. However, she revealed the vision she saw to no one but, pretending that she knew no part of the mischief, devised with herself how she might take revenge on the traitor, and finish her own sorrowful life. Soon Thrasyllus arrived, the detestable demander of sudden pleasure, and wearied the closed ears of Charite with talk of marriage. But she gently refused his conversation and, dissembling the matter with passing craft in the midst of his earnest desires, said, ‘Thrasyllus, you must understand that the face of your brother and my husband is always before my eyes. I still smell the cinnamon scent of his precious body, I still feel Tlepolemus alive in my heart. Wherefore you will do well if you grant to me, miserable woman, the necessary time to bewail his death until, after the passage of a few months, the year comes to a close. This pertains both to my shame and to your wholesome profit, lest it happen by your speed and quick marriage we should justly raise and provoke the spirit of my husband to work our destruction.’ <br><br>
[10] “However, Thrasyllus was not content with this promise, but more and more came upon her. Thus she was forced to speak to him in this manner: ‘My friend Thrasyllus, if you can wait until the whole year is complete and finished, behold, here is my body, take your pleasure, but in such a way and so secretly that no servant of the house may perceive it.’ Then Thrasyllus, trusting to the false promises of the woman, and preferring his inordinate pleasure above all things in the world, was joyful in his heart and looked for a night when he might fulfill his desire. ‘Come about midnight,’ said Charite, ‘disguised and without company, and hiss at my chamber door, and my nurse shall attend and let you in.’ <br><br>
[11] “This counsel pleased Thrasyllus marvelously, who (suspecting no harm) continually yearned for the night and the hour assigned by Charite. The time had scarce come, when (according to her command) he disguised himself and went straight to the chamber where he found the nurse waiting for him. She (by the order of her mistress) fed him with flattering talk, and gave him drugged drink in a cup, excusing the absence of her mistress Charite. She said that she was attending to her father who was sick. Then, with sweet talk and the operation of the wine, he fell sound asleep. Now when he lay prostrate and exposed on the ground, Charite (being called for) came in, and with manly courage and bold force stood over the sleeping murderer and said: <br><br>
[12] “‘Behold the faithful companion of my husband, behold this valiant hunter; behold, my dear spouse, this is the hand which shed my blood, this is the heart which devised so many subtle means to work my destruction, these are the eyes that I have ill pleased. Behold now they foreshow their own destiny. Sleep without care, dream that you are in the hands of the merciful, for I will not hurt you with your sword or any other weapon. God forbid that I should slay you as you slew my husband. But your eyes shall fail you, and you shall see no more what you dream of. You shall think the death of your enemy more sweet than your life. You shall see no light, you shall lack the aid of a leader, you shall not have me as you hoped, you shall have no delight of my marriage. You shall not die, and yet living you shall have no joy, but wander between light and darkness as an unsure image. You shall seek for the hand that pricked out your eyes, yet you shall not know whom you should complain of. I will make sacrifice with the blood of your eyes upon the grave of my husband. But what do you gain through my delay? Perhaps you dream that you embrace me in your arms. Leave off the darkness of sleep and awake to receive as penalty the deprivation of your sight. Lift up your face, think about your vengeance and evil fortune, reckon your misery. So pleasant are your eyes to a chaste woman that you shall have blindness as your companion, and an everlasting remorse on your miserable conscience.’ <br><br>
[13] “When she had spoken these words, she took a great needle from her head and pricked out both his eyes. This done, she by and by took up the naked sword which her husband Tlepolemus was accustomed to wear, and ran throughout all the city like a mad woman towards the tomb of her husband. Then all of us of the house, with all the citizens, ran quickly after her to take the sword out of her hand. But she, clasping the tomb of Tlepolemus, kept us off with her naked weapon, and when she perceived that every one of us wept and lamented, she spoke in this way: ‘I pray you, my friends, weep not, nor lament for me, for I have revenged the death of my husband, I have punished deservedly the wicked breaker of our marriage. Now is it time to seek out my sweet Tlepolemus, and presently with this sword to finish my life.’ <br><br>
[14] “And after she had related the whole matter, declared the vision which she saw, and told by what means she had deceived Thrasyllus, she, thrusting her sword under her right breast and wallowing in her own blood, at length with manly courage yielded up the ghost. Then immediately the friends of miserable Charite buried her body within the same tomb. Thrasyllus, hearing all the matter and not knowing not by what means he might end his life (for he thought his sword was not sufficient to revenge so great a crime), at length went to the same tomb and cried with a loud voice, saying: ‘O you dead spirits whom I have so highly and greatly offended, vouchsafe to receive me. Behold I make sacrifice to you with my whole body.’ This said, he closed the tomb, purposing to famish himself, and to finish his life there in sorrow.” <br><br>
[15] These things the young man, with pitiful sighs and tears, declared to the cowherds and shepherds, which caused them all to weep. But they, fearing to become subject to new masters, prepared to depart. By and by the groom, to whom the charge of me was committed, brought forth all his possessions, and loaded me and other horses with them, and so departed thence. We bore women, children, pullets, sparrows, kids, whelps, and other things that were not able to keep pace with us. The burden I bore upon my back, although it was a mighty burden, seemed very light because I was driven away from him who most terribly had appointed to kill me. When we had passed over a great mountain full of trees, and had come again into the open fields, behold, we approached near to a fair and rich castle where, it was told to us, we were not able to pass in our journey that night, because of the great number of terrible wolves that were in the area. The wolves were so fierce and cruel that they put every man in fear, such that they could invade and set upon those who passed by like thieves, and devour both them and their beasts. Moreover, we were told that there lay in our path many dead bodies eaten and torn by the wolves. Wherefore we were forced to stay there all night and, the next morning, to proceed close together so that we might escape all dangers. <br><br>
[16] But (notwithstanding this good counsel) our wretched drivers were so covetous to go forward, and so fearful of pursuit that they did not wait until the morning. But being nearly midnight, they made us trudge our way apace. Then I, fearing the potential danger, ran amongst the other horses so that I might defend and save my poor buttocks from the wolves. Every man marveled to see that I ran more swiftly then the other horses. But such was my agility, not to obtain any praise, but rather for fear. At that time I remembered that the valiant horse Pegasus flew in the air more to avoid the danger of the dreadful Chimera than for anything else. The shepherds who drove us before them were well-armed like warriors:.One had a spear, another had a sheep hook, some had darts, some clubs, some gathered up great stones, some held up their sharp javelins, and some frightened off the wolves with lighted firebrands. Finally we lacked nothing to make up an army except drums and trumpets. But when we had fearfully passed these dangers, we happened to fall into worse. The wolves did not come upon us, either because of the great multitude of our company, or else because of our firebrands, or perhaps they had gone to some other place, for we could see none. <br><br>
[17] However, the inhabitants of the next village (supposing that we were thieves by reason of our great number), in order to defend their own possessions and out of fear, sent great and mighty dogs upon us, which they had kept and nourished for the safety of their houses. These dogs, surrounding us, leaped on every side, tearing us with their teeth such that they pulled many of us to the ground. Verily it was a pitiful sight to see so many dogs, some following those who fled, some attacking those who stood still, some tearing those who lay prostrate. Generally there were none who escaped clear. <br><br>
[18] Behold, after this another danger ensued. The inhabitants of the town stood in their garrets and windows, and threw great stones on our heads. Thus we could not tell whether it was best for us to avoid the gaping mouths of the dogs at hand or the peril of the stones from afar. Among the townspeople there was one that hurled a great stone at a woman who sat upon my back. She cried out piteously, and asked her husband to help her. Then he (coming to aid his wife) began to speak as follows: “Alas, masters, why do you trouble us poor working men so cruelly? Why do you take revenge on us, who do you no harm? What do you think you will gain from us? You do not dwell in caves or dens. You are not barbarous people who delight in effusion of human blood.” At these words the tempest of stones ceased, and the storm of dogs vanished. Then one of them (standing on the top of a great cypress tree) spoke to us: “Don’t think, masters, that we do this to rifle or take away any of your goods, but in order to safeguard ourselves and families. Now in God’s name you may depart away.” So we went forward, some wounded by stones, some bitten by dogs, and overall no one escaped unscathed. When we had gone a good way, we came to a certain wood containing great trees and surrounded by pleasant meadows. Our company of shepherds decided to go to this place in order to cure their wounds and sores. Then they sat down on the ground to refresh their weary minds, and afterwards they sought medicine to heal their bodies. Some washed away their blood with the water from the river. Some stopped their wounds with sponges and cloths. In this manner everyone provided for his own well-being. <br><br>
[19] In the meantime we perceived an old man who seemed to be a shepherd, by reason of the goats and sheep that grazed around him. Then one of our company demanded whether he had any milk, butter, or cheese to sell. He answered, saying: “Do you look for any food or drink, or any other refection here? Don’t you know you where you are?” And thereupon he took his sheep and drove them away as fast as he could. This answer made our shepherds greatly afraid, such that they thought of nothing else but to enquire what country they were in. However they saw no one whom they might ask. They were thus in doubt for a long time. Then they perceived another old man with a staff in his hand and very weary with travel, who was drawing near our company. He began to weep and complain saying: <br><br>
[20] “Alas, masters, I pray you help me, a miserable wretch, and restore my nephew to me again. He, by following a sparrow flying before him, fell into a ditch nearby, and verily I think he is in danger of death. As for me, I am not able to help him because of my old age. But you, who are so valiant and lusty, may easily help me, and deliver me my boy, my heir and the guide of my life. <br><br>
[21] These words made us all pity him. And then the youngest and stoutest of our company, who alone escaped least harmed from the recent skirmish with the dogs and stones, rose up and demanded in what ditch the boy had fallen. He said, “Indeed, over yonder,” and pointed with his finger. Our companion accompanied the old man to a great thicket of bushes and thorns which they both entered. In the meantime, after we cured our wounds, we took up our packs, intending to depart. And because we did not want to go away without our young companion, the shepherds whistled and called for him. But when he gave no answer, they sent one of our company to seek him out. He after a while returned again with a pale face and sorrowful news, saying that he saw a terrible dragon eating and devouring their companion. And, as for the old man, he could see him nowhere. When they heard this, (remembering likewise the words of the first old man who had shaken his head and driven away his sheep) they ran away beating us before them, to fly from this deserted and pestilent country. <br><br>
[22] After we had passed a great part of our journey, we came to a village where we rested all night. But hearken, and I will tell you what mischief happened there. You shall understand there was a servant whom his master had placed in charge of his house, and was master of the lodging where we rested. This servant had married a maiden of the same house, but was greatly in love with a harlot from the town, and accustomed to meet with her. His wife was so highly displeased with this and became so jealous that she gathered together all her husband’s possessions, with his books of account, and threw them into a fire. She was not content with this, but she took a cord and bound her child, which she had by her husband, about her middle and cast her self headlong into a deep pit. The master, taking the death of these two badly, took his servant, whose wanton behavior was the cause of this murder, and, after he had taken off all his clothing, he anointed his body with honey, and then bound him to a fig-tree. In a rotten stalk of this tree a great number of ants had built their nests. The ants, after they had smelled the sweetness of the honey came upon his body and little by little (in continuance of time) devoured all his flesh. Thus there remained on the tree nothing but his bare bones: <br><br>
[23] This was declared to us by the inhabitants of the village there, who greatly sorrowed for the death of this servant. Then we, likewise wanting to avoid this dreadful lodging quickly departed. After this we came to a fair city, very populous, where our shepherds determined enter, since it seemed a place where they might live unknown and far from those who would pursue them. They also thought that it was a country very plentiful of grain and other victuals. After we had stayed the space of three days, I, poor ass, and the other horses were fed and kept in the stable to so that we might seem more saleable. We were brought out at length to the market, and soon a crier sounded his horn to signify that we were to be sold. All my companion horses were bought up by gentlemen, but I remained there forsaken of all men. And many buyers came by and looked in my mouth to know mine age. I was so weary with opening my jaws that at length (unable to endure any longer) when one came with a stinking pair of hands and grated my gums with his filthy fingers, I bit them clean off. This caused the bystanders to forsake me as a fierce and cruel beast. The crier, when he had gotten a hoarse voice, and saw that no man would buy me, began to mock me saying, “Why do we stand here with this wild ass, this feeble beast, this slow nag with worn-out hooves, good for nothing but to make sieves from his skin? Why do we not give him away to somebody since he does not earn his hay? <br><br>
[24] In this manner he made all the bystanders laugh exceedingly. But my evil fortune which was ever so cruel to me, which I having traversed so many countries could in no way escape, assailed me even more. It devised new means to afflict my poor body by giving me a new master, as spiteful as the rest. There was an old man somewhat bald, with long and gray hair, who was one of those that go from door to door throughout all the villages, bearing the image of a Syrian goddess Syria. These people play with cymbals in order to get the alms from good and charitable folks. This old man came hastily towards the crier and demanded where I was bred. “In Cappadocia,” he answered. Then he enquired what age I was. The crier answered that the mathematician who took my horoscope said I was five years old. Then he and told the old man to look in my mouth. He continued: “For I would not willingly incur the penalty of the Cornelian law byselling a free citizen as a servile slave. In God’s name just buy this fair beast to ride home and about the country.” But this curious buyer never stopped asking about my qualities, and at length he demanded whether I was gentle or not. <br><br>
[25] The crier said, “Gentle, as gentle as a lamb, and amenable to all use. He will never bite, he will never kick, but you would think that under the shape of an ass there was some well-advised man. Indeed this you may easily see, for if you thrust your nose in his tail you shall perceive how patient he is. Thus the crier mocked the old man but he, perceiving his taunts and jests, grew very angry and said, “Away you foolish crier! I pray the omnipotent Syrian goddess, parent to all, sacred Sabazius, Bellona, the mother of Ida, and Venus with Adonis, to strike out both your eyes, since you with have scoffed at me with taunts. Do you think that I would put the goddess upon the back of a fierce beast, such that her divine image might be thrown down on the ground? Thus I, poor wretch, would be compelled (tearing my hair) to look for a physician to help her!” When I heard him speak thus, I thought that I should suddenly leap upon him like a mad ass, in order to prevent him from buying me. But soon the buyer prevented this by quickly offering seventeen denars for me. My master was glad and received the money, and delivered me to my new master, who was called Philebus. <br><br>
[26] This priest brought me home, and when he came to his house he called out his daughters saying, “Behold my daughters what a gentle servant I have bought for you!” But the daughters were really catamite men. They were at first very happy and, coming out shouting for joy, were thinking that Philebus had brought home a fit and amenable servant for their purposes. But when they perceived that I was an ass, they began to provoke him, saying that he had not bought a servant for his maidens but rather a spouse for himself. They said, “However, do not keep him wholly for your own riding, but let us likewise have him at our command.” Thereupon they led me into the stable and tied me to the manger. There was a certain young man with a mighty body, skilled at playing on instruments to get money who (as soon as he had saw me) entertained me very well. He filled my manger full of food, and spoke merrily saying, “O master ass, I pray to God you live a long time and please my master well so that you may continually deliver me from so great pain.” When I heard these words I foresaw for myself more misery to come. <br><br>
[27] The following day I saw a great number of persons appareled in various colors and having painted faces, miters on their heads, vestments colored like saffron, and scarves of silk. On their feet were yellow shoes. These people attired the image of the goddess in a purple robe and put her on my back. Then they went forth with their arms naked to their shoulders, bearing great swords and mighty axes, and dancing like mad persons. After they had passed many small villages, they happened to come to the house of some wealthy person. Upon entering they began to hurl themselves hither and thither as though they were mad. They made a thousand gestures with their feet and hands, they would bite themselves. Finally everyone took his own weapon and wounded his own arms in various places. Amongst them was one more mad then the rest, who uttered many deep sighs from the bottom of his heart, as though he had been possessed in spirit or filled with divine power. <br><br>
[28] Afterward, having somewhat returned to himself, he invented and forged a great lie, saying, that he had displeased the divine majesty of the goddess by doing something which was not allowed by their holy religion. Wherefore he said he would punish himself. Thereupon he took a whip and scourged his own body such that the blood issued out abundantly. It caused me great fear to see such wounds and effusion of blood, lest the same goddess, desiring so much the blood of men, should likewise desire the blood of an ass. After they grew weary with hurling and beating themselves, they sat down and behold, the inhabitants came in, and offered gold, silver, vessels of wine, milk, cheese, flour, wheat and other things. Amongst these people there was one who brought barley for the ass that carried the goddess. But the greedy whoresons thrust it all into their sack, which they had brought for the purpose, and put it upon my back. Thus I could serve two purposes, that is to say, as a barn by reason of my grain, and as a temple by reason of the statue. <br><br>
[29] In this way they went from place to place, robbing all the country over. At length they came to a certain castle where, under pretense of divination, they obtained a fat sheep from a poor husbandman for the goddess’ supper and to make sacrifice with. After that the banquet was prepared, they washed their bodies and brought in a tall young man of the village to dine with them. He had scarcely tasted his pottage when he began to discover their beastly customs and inordinate desire of luxury. For they surrounded the young man as he sat at the table and abused him, contrary to all nature and reason. When I beheld this horrible deed, I wanted to say, “O citizens!” But I could only pronounce the first letter O, which I roared out so valiantly that the young men of the town, seeking for a stray ass that they had lost the same night, and hearing my voice, whereby they judged that I was theirs. They entered the house unawares and found these persons committing their vile abomination. When they saw what was going on, they declared to all the inhabitants nearby their unnatural villainy, mocking and laughing at this the pure and clean chastity of their religion. <br><br>
[30] In the meantime Phelibus and his company (by reason of the rumor of their beastly wickedness which was dispersed throughout all the region there) put all their equipment upon my back and departed away about midnight. When we had passed a great part of our journey, before the rising of the sun, we came into a wild desert where they conspired together to slay me. For after they had taken the goddess from my back and set her gingerly upon the ground, they likewise took off my harness and bound me surely to an oak, beating me with their whip in such a way that I nearly died. Amongst these men there was one who threatened to cut off my legs with his hatchet, because by my noise I defamed his chastity. But the others, considering more their own profit than my utility, thought it best to spare my life because I could carry home the goddess. So they loaded me up again and drove me before them with their naked swords until they came to a noble city. Here the principal citizen, bearing high reverence for the goddess, came with great devotion before us with drums, cymbals, and other instruments, and received her and all our company with much sacrifice and veneration. <br><br>
[31] But there I remember I thought I was in most danger, for there was one who brought to the master of the house a side of a fat buck for a present. This was hanging behind the kitchen door not far from the ground, and was clean eaten up by a greyhound that had come in. The cook, when he saw the venison had been devoured, lamented and wept pitifully. And because supper time approached, in order to avoid being reproved of too much negligence, he took up a halter to hang himself. But his wife, perceiving what he was doing, ran quickly up to him and, taking the halter in both her hands, stopped him of his intent, saying, “O husband, are you out of your mind? Follow my counsel: carry this strange ass out into some secret place and kill him. This done, cut off one of his sides and sauce it well like the side of the buck, and set it before your master.” Then the cook, hearing the counsel of his wife, was well pleased to slay me and to save himself. And so he went to the whetstone to sharpen his tools accordingly. <br><br>
